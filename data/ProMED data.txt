It's a bacterial infection spread by ticks that strikes thousands of Brits every year. Now	 an interactive map reveals where in England Lyme disease has infected the most people.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The bacteria	 which causes a circular rash around the bite	 as well as a fever	 headache and tiredness	 was detected among more than 1000 people across the country last year [2022]. But that figure	 which only reflects lab-confirmed infections	 doesn't include the thousands of patients unwell with Lyme disease but aren't tested. Experts are urging people to stay safe when outdoors this spring and summer	 warning that the once rare disease is now on the rise in the UK. ;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Since the UK's 1st confirmed case in 1985	 the recorded incidence of Lyme disease has steadily been increasing. Data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) for 2022 show that there were 1156 lab-confirmed cases of Lyme disease in England and Wales.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Nearly three-quarters (72.6%) of the country logged an infection last year [2022]	 with only 84 of England's more than 300 regions remaining free from Lyme disease. Somerset was the worst-hit part of the country	 logging 32 cases	 followed by Dorset (21)	 Bristol (20) and Wiltshire (19). Bath and North East Somerset (17)	 Hammersmith and Fulham (17)	 Winchester (16) and New Forest (15) also logged more than a dozen cases	 as did Somerset West and Taunton (15).;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
But	 in addition to these laboratory-confirmed cases	 there is an estimated 1000 to 2000 additional cases of the bacterial infection each year. As a result	 charity Lyme Disease UK says that 3000 to 4000 people in England and Wales are affected annually. However	 it warns that this could still be a gross underestimate due to lack of awareness about the condition and misdiagnosis. In fact	 a research paper	 published in the journal BMJ Open in 2019	 suggested that the figure is possible 3 times higher than official stats [ProMED post Lyme disease - UK: updated reporting 20190802.6601464].;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Natasha Metcalf, co-founder and chair of Lyme Disease UK, is urging people to protect themselves against the disease. She said: """"We don't want people to be scared of enjoying the outdoors, but rather that people go out armed with the facts and knowledge they need to protect themselves and others from Lyme disease. Early intervention is key, and getting that message out to the public is crucial."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The bacteria are spread by ticks	 which are tiny spider-like critters that vary from reddish to black in colour and can be the size of a poppy seed or a baked bean. The bugs can be found across every county in the UK	 but they mainly inhabit grassy areas in woodlands	 in urban parks and gardens. It's thought around 10% of ticks in the UK carry Lyme disease	 an infection caused by a spiral-shaped bacteria called _Borrelia burgdorferi_ that is spread through their bites.;;;;;;;;;;

[As shown by the interactive map available in the news report above	 most laboratory-confirmed cases in 2022 occurred in the South West Region of England	 which includes the counties of Somerset	 Dorset	 Bristol	 and Wiltshire	 and districts of Bath and North East Somerset and Somerset West and Taunton. Some locations in the southwestern portion of the South East Region had greater than 10 cases each in 2022	 including the districts of Winchester	 East Hampshire	 Chichester	 Test Valley	 and New Forest. Hammersmith and Fulham	 a western borough in Inner London	 had 17 cases.;;;;;;;;;;												
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the Northern hemisphere	 occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America	 Europe and Asia. It is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete	 _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato group. Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks	 and various small and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The species of tick	 the host species	 borrelial genospecies and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the main pathogenic species identified in North America. It also occurs in Europe but is less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_	 the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies; all are present in the UK	 and _B. garinii_ appears to be the most prevalent pathogenic genospecies in most endemic areas of this country (<https://tinyurl.com/5xjb9ama>).;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In Europe	 _B. burgdorferi_ genospecies that cause Lyme borreliosis are mainly transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. In a literature review of studies of the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato in _I. ricinus_ ticks in various European countries	 the overall mean prevalence of _B. burgdorferi _ in ticks was 13.7%; for the UK the prevalence ranged from 3.9 to 8.5 (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/>).;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Increases in incidence of Lyme disease are likely the result of several factors that include: 1) greater recognition	 2) improved reporting	 as well as 3) a true increase in disease incidence due to more people living in suburban neighborhoods near wooded areas with enlarging populations of deer	 which	 although not susceptible to Lyme disease	 supply the adult tick with a required blood meal; enlarging populations of both the white-footed mouse and other small rodents (the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease) and spirochete-infected nymphal _I. scapularis_	 the primary vector for Lyme disease; and climatic conditions that favor proliferation of the tick	 mouse and deer populations.;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Localized early Lyme disease is clinically characterized by erythema migrans (EM) usually occurring at the site of the tick bite 1 to 2 weeks after a tick bite in 70% of patients. The diagnosis of Lyme disease is usually made clinically based on the appearance of the classic rash and a history of recent tick exposure in endemic areas	 before a measurable antibody response in immunocompetent patients; the diagnosis of Lyme disease cannot be laboratory-confirmed at this point (<https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/resources/halperin_2012_chap4_johnsonb.pdf>). Data that rely only on laboratory confirmation will therefore miss a large proportion of those infected.;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
As in the UK	 Lyme disease is underreported in the United States. Lyme disease became nationally notifiable in the United States in 1991	 and the annual number of confirmed cases reported to the CDC since then has steadily risen. In 2013 the CDC reported that although more than 30 000 cases were reported annually	 they estimated about 300 000 Americans get Lyme disease each year	 10 times higher than the yearly reported number (<https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0819-lyme-disease.html> and ProMED post Lyme disease - USA (04): underreporting 20130822.1894924). - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;;;

A new Lyme test for horses holds promise in humans -- and dogs.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
---------------------------------------------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The veterinarians were puzzled. They had a horse which was clearly sick	 but they didn't know why.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
This wasn't just any horse. It was a performance horse	 preparing for competition. (For those in the horse world	 we're talking about an 11-year-old Swedish Warmblood mare.);;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The veterinarians suspected neurologic Lyme disease	 but couldn't confirm.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
It just so happened researchers at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and University of Maryland	 led by Steven Schutzer	 a Rutgers professor of medicine	 were working to refine a new method to detect the disease.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Schutzer's team tested the spinal fluid of the horse	 and sure enough	 it was Lyme.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
This new test holds promise for humans -- and dogs	 too. It's about time. Lyme is the most common vector-borne illness in the U.S. Based on insurance records	 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimates 476 000 people are diagnosed with Lyme every year. The disease is particularly prevalent in Southeastern Pennsylvania.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Most cases can be treated with a few weeks of antibiotics	 the CDC says. But early detection is important. If left untreated	 what began as a fever	 headache	 fatigue	 and a rash can progress to affect the nervous system	 joints	 and heart.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
How are humans tested for Lyme now	 and what are the shortcomings?;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
------------------------------------------------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
They are serology antibody tests	 tests for looking in a person's blood which might indicate infection with Lyme. They are the only ones approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (Patients who have been tested may be familiar with 2 test names -- ELISA and Western Blot. Although slightly different	 both are serology antibody tests.);;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
But these tests are indirect -- measuring only the body's response to exposure to _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 the microbe causing the disease. So	 the antibody tests do not indicate active disease. They can only tell you	 in the best circumstances	 you've been exposed to the microbe. It doesn't tell you when. Is it right now	 or a year ago	 or 5 years ago?;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Another problem with the antibody tests is a high rate of false negatives if they are used too early in the 1st couple of weeks of the infection.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
How is the test you're developing different?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
--------------------------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
We were working on a DNA test. With that	 you are searching for parts of the microbe itself	 specifically the DNA. So we oriented the test to target just _Borrelia burgdoferi_ DNA. If you find the DNA of _Borrelia_ circulating in your blood or spinal fluid	 you almost certainly have active Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
This type of test and other DNA tests are not yet FDA-approved for humans	 but it is being used in some research settings and clinical labs.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
One advantage of this test is it's the same	 whether you're testing a horse	 a dog	 or a human. You're looking for the DNA of the microbe	 not antibodies. Antibodies are specific to the host. Dog antibodies and horse antibodies might be different from human antibodies.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
But the shortcoming of DNA tests in general	 in the case of Lyme disease	 is in whatever sample you have -- blood	 spinal fluid -- there may be very few copies of the DNA you're looking for. The nature of the Lyme agent is it is not in abundance in the body's tissues. Its DNA is not all over the place. Whereas if you had a common viral infection	 it's easy to find if it's there.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
So you want to do things which seem to enrich that specific target -- in the sea of the host DNA -- so you can determine whether it's there. That's what we were doing in our research.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Let's say you go to the beach and you want to find pink grains of sand where otherwise the beach seems white. Consider the pink grains to represent the pathogenic microbe. So it would be good if you could do something to increase the relative number of pink grains of sand in your sample.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Maybe by getting rid of a lot of white sand	 which leaves	 in proportion	 more pink grains of sand. Or imagine if you had a specific hook to grab only pink sand	 even if it's hard to see. Then you've got a better chance of finding the pink sand -- or	 in this case	 the DNA of the microbes -- if you apply a test.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
We were working to see if we could isolate those pink grains of sand	 those microbes.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
So what happened with the horse?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
--------------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
While we were doing this	 one of our veterinary colleagues at Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine in New York told us about an interesting case of what they thought was neurologic Lyme disease in a horse affecting its brain. It turns out central nervous system neurologic Lyme in a horse is rarely definitively confirmed until the horse dies and they do a necropsy. It has bedeviled veterinarians for years.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
With humans	 you need special permission to involve them in a research study. You need their approval. We didn't need that for a horse. The owners can give the permission. So they gave us some spinal fluid	 and we tested it. And we found the very specific DNA of the offending microbes -- _Borrelia burgdorferi_.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
By treating the horse	 veterinarians were able to return the animal to athletic high performance status.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Cornell veterinarians also sent us spinal fluid from another horse having been treated for neurologic Lyme disease and was well on its way to recovery. In theory	 if you eradicated the infection	 the DNA of microbes should no longer be detectable in the spinal fluid. And sure enough	 we didn't find any.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
This was a convergence -- specialists in veterinary medicine and human medicine sharing information.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Since the test worked for the horse	 could it work in humans?;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
-------------------------------------------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Yes. It holds promise. It also holds promise for use in dogs	 which also get Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
We hope it could be another diagnostic arrow in the quiver	 a better test to be applied to detecting active Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
What are the next steps?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
One obvious thing is to refine the test in the laboratory. We can work on making tweaks to make the test more effective.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
But the real thing is getting more numbers in the next couple of seasons	 increasing the numbers of cases so your research colleagues	 the medical community and the regulatory agencies believe it is working and is an improvement.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
We hope to do that.;;;;;;;;;;

Whether it's because summers are getting longer or we're spending more time outdoors in nature	 or simply because we're testing more	 it seems that the number of Lyme disease cases has been on the rise in the past decade. According to a new study	 14% of the world's population currently has or has had tickborne Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Ticks are parasites that feed off the blood of mammals	 birds	 and sometimes even reptiles or amphibians. They can also carry a lot of diseases. _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato (Bb) infection	 more commonly known as Lyme disease	 is the commonest type of tickborne infection.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Diagnosing the disease can be very difficult. The commonest sign of infection is a red rash that appears around the site of the tick bite about a week later. The bite and the rash are typically neither itchy nor painful	 which makes it more difficult to diagnose -- but the consequences can be severe. Early symptoms can include fever and headaches	 and if untreated	 Lyme disease can cause damage to facial nerves	 paralysis	 arthritis	 heart	 palpitations	 joint pains	 and several other serious problems (including impaired memory). Even if treated	 Lyme disease causes joint pains	 memory problems	 and tiredness in about 10-20% of cases.;;;;;;;;;;													
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A team of researchers at Kunming Medical University in China looked at over 4000 studies	 selecting 137 of them and ultimately pooling data from 89 studies with almost 160 000 participants. The results suggest a global prevalence of Lyme disease of 14.5% -- in other words	 1 in 7 people in the world either have the disease or have had it.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The highest prevalence was in central and western Europe (21% and 13.5%	 respectively) and in Eastern Asia (16%). In Southern Asia and the Caribbean	 the prevalence was 2-3%. In North America	 the rate was about 9%. The people most likely to get Lyme disease were over 50	 males	 and often lived in rural areas.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The results also suggest that the prevalence of Lyme disease in the 2011-2020 decade was higher than in 2001-2010	 which could be linked to climate change	 which could expand the preferred habitat of ticks (more research is required to see exactly why this is happening). Lower rainfall	 animal migration	 fragmentation of habitats	 and more time spent outdoor could also be factors at play.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The researchers call for more long-term studies to assess how big an impact the disease is having. A more accurate picture of the global distribution could """"inform the development of public health response policies and [Lyme disease] control programmes"""", they suggest.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is older than the human race and has been around for at least 15 million years. Ticks and the bacteria they carry are very opportunistic	 and in many parts of the world (such as Europe or North America) they're a more important vector of disease than mosquitoes. In the US	 some 30 000 cases of Lyme disease are reported every year	 but the real number is actually much higher.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"A vaccine was approved for use for Lyme disease in 1998, but it was discontinued in 2002 due to """"insufficient consumer demand"""", according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/prev/vaccine.html>]. Several treatments are also currently being researched [<https://www.zmescience.com/science/lyme-disease-new-treatment-options-151423/> and <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59600-4>].;;;;;;;;;;"

Introduction;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
_Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato (Bb) infection	 the most frequent tick-transmitted disease	 is distributed worldwide. This study aimed to describe the global seroprevalence and sociodemographic characteristics of Bb in human populations.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Methods;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
We searched PubMed	 Embase	 Web of Science	 and other sources for relevant studies of all study designs through 30 Dec 2021 with the following keywords: '_Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato' AND 'infection rate'; and observational studies were included if the results of human Bb antibody seroprevalence surveys were reported	 the laboratory serological detection method reported and be published in a peer-reviewed journal. We screened titles/abstracts and full texts of papers and appraised the risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration-endorsed Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Data were synthesised narratively	 and stratified by different types of outcomes. We also conducted random effects meta-analysis where we had a minimum of two studies with 95% CIs reported. The study protocol has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021261362).;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Results;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Of 4196 studies	 137 were eligible for full-text screening	 and 89 (158 287 individuals) were included in meta-analyses. The reported estimated global Bb seroprevalence was 14.5% (95% CI 12.8% to 16.3%)	 and the top three regions of Bb seroprevalence were Central Europe (20.7%	 95% CI 13.8% to 28.6%)	 Eastern Asia (15.9%	 95% CI 6.6% to 28.3%) and Western Europe (13.5%	 95% CI 9.5% to 18.0%). Meta-regression analysis showed that after eliminating confounding risk factors	 the methods lacked western blotting (WB) confirmation and increased the risk of false-positive Bb antibody detection compared with the methods using WB confirmation (OR 1.9	 95% CI 1.6 to 2.2). Other factors associated with Bb seropositivity include age ≥50 years (12.6%	 95% CI 8.0% to 18.1%)	 men (7.8%	 95% CI 4.6% to 11.9%)	 residence of rural area (8.4%	 95% CI 5.0% to 12.6%) and suffering tick bites (18.8%	 95% CI 10.1% to 29.4%).;;;;;;;;;;										
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Conclusion;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The reported estimated global Bb seropositivity is relatively high, with the top three regions as Central Europe, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia. Using the WB to confirm Bb serological results could significantly improve the accuracy. More studies are needed to improve the accuracy of global Lyme borreliosis burden estimates."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
----;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease or LD) is the commonest human tickborne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere	 occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America	 Europe	 and Asia. An estimated 300 000 cases occur each year in the United States (<https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0819-lyme-disease.html>) and 85 000 cases in Europe (<http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/96819/E89522.pdf>). The patterns of disease differ by geographical location. For example	 acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and neuroborreliosis are commoner in Europe	 whereas arthritis appears to be prevalent in the United States. The borrelial genospecies	 the species of tick	 the reservoir host species	 and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks also all vary by geographical location.;;;;;;;;;;																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Of the more than 20 _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato (Bbsl) complex genospecies	 only a few (for example	 _B. afzelii_	 _B. garinii_	 and _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto) are human pathogens: _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto (Bbss) is the predominant cause of LD in North America; Bbss also occurs in Europe but is less prevalent than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_	 the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies.;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The vectors of Bbsl	 which feed on both humans and reservoir species are 4 species of hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks: _I. scapularis_ is the main vector of Bbsl for humans in the eastern half of the US; _I. pacificus_	 in the far-western US; _I. ricinus_	 in Europe; and _I. persulcatus_	 in Asia. The prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato in _I. ricinus_ ticks in various European countries was found to be 13.7% (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/>). Regions with the highest infection rates were located in central Europe (Austria	 Czech Republic	 southern Germany	 Switzerland	 Slovakia	 and Slovenia); in Switzerland	 13.6 to 49% of ticks were infected. In the Austria/Switzerland region	 of positive ticks	 25% were infected with _B. afzelii_	 44% with _B. garinii_	 and 25% with Bbss. The infection rate in adult ticks (18.6%) was higher than in nymphs (10.1%). No significant difference was seen when the prevalence of each _Borrelia_ species in nymphs was compared to that in adults (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/>).;;;;;;											
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Various small- and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts. Migration of birds	 which serve as hosts for the infected ticks	 may be the cause of the expanding distribution of Bbsl.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Individual hard-bodied ixodes ticks can be infected with more than one genospecies of Bbsl complex	 as well as multiple other pathogens	 including _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_	 the cause of anaplasmosis (also known as human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA)	 _Babesia microti_	 the cause of babesiosis	 _Borrelia miyamotoi_	 the cause of a relapsing fever-like illness	 and tickborne encephalitis virus or TBEV	 the cause of tickborne encephalitis (TBE). It is	 therefore	 possible that co-infections with 2 or more of these tickborne pathogens may occur.;;;;;;;;;;														
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Typically	 the nymph stage of the tick	 which is about the size of a poppy seed	 transmits these diseases. For a picture of the nymph	 see <http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/>. - Mod.ML];;;;;;;;;;

More than 20% of the ticks analyzed in all Latvian laboratories have been tested positive for Lyme _Borrelia_ [bacteria] this year [2023]. _Borrelia_ can cause Lyme disease against which there are no vaccines. The other dangerous tick-borne illness -- encephalitis -- has only been found in a few ticks	 Latvian Television reported on 26 May 2023.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
At the Latvian Infectology Center	 encephalitis has not been detected at all this year [2023]	 but 26% of the tested ticks have shown _Borrelia_. Most testing is done by the Central Laboratory	 where out of 710 ticks tested	 4 tested positive for encephalitis but 23% [?] were positive for Lyme [_Borrelia_]	 said Central Laboratory's board member Jeļena Storoženko.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Currently	 ticks are very active. It is important to remove a tick as soon as it is found. After removing the tick	 it is recommended that you pay attention to possible flu-like symptoms and address the doctor in case such appear. Lyme disease is treated with antibiotics.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Last year [2022]	 50 patients with tick-borne encephalitis and 11 patients with Lyme disease were treated at the Latvian Infectology Center. Currently one person is being treated as an inpatient for a severe case of Lyme.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There is no vaccine against Lyme disease	 but not everyone catches it. The immune system can beat _Borrelia_ on its own [asymptomatic infection].;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
If you wish to test a tick in a laboratory	 it must be brought there within 72 hours. It must not be dried or squashed.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
According to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control	 Latvia is among Europe's tick hotspots (<https://atlas.ecdc.europa.eu/public/index.aspx?Dataset=27&HealthTopic=56>).

[Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease or LD) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere	 occurring predominantly in temperate regions of North America	 Europe	 and Asia. Of the more than 20 _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato (Bbsl) complex genospecies	 only a few (for example	 _B. afzelii_	 _B. garinii_	 and _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto) are human pathogens: _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto (Bbss) is the predominant cause of LD in North America; Bbss also occurs in Europe but is less prevalent than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_	 the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies.;;;;;;;;;																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The vectors of Bbsl	 which feed on both humans and reservoir species	 are 4 species of hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks: _I. scapularis_ is the main vector of Bbsl for humans in the eastern half of the United States; _I. pacificus_	 in the far-western United States; _I. ricinus_	 in Europe; and _I. persulcatus_	 in Asia. The Central European region (Austria	 Czech Republic	 southern Germany	 Switzerland	 Slovakia	 and Slovenia) has been reported to have the highest _Borrelia_ infection rates in _I. ricinus_ ticks (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/>); in Switzerland	 13.6% to 49% of ticks were infected. In the Austria/Switzerland region	 of positive ticks	 25% were infected with _B. afzelii_	 44% with _B. garinii_	 and 25% with Bbss. The infection rate in adult ticks (18.6%) was higher than in nymphs (10.1%). The above news report adds Latvia to this list of countries with over 20% of ticks infected with presumably a species of _Borrelia_ capable of causing LD.;;;;;;										
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The clinical manifestations of LD vary by geographical location. For example	 acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and neuroborreliosis are more common in Europe	 whereas arthritis appears to be prevalent in the United States. Lyme neuroborreliosis is multifaceted	 causing symptoms as a result of central and/or peripheral nervous system involvement; LD can cause meningitis	 cranial neuritis	 radiculoneuritis	 peripheral neuropathy	 and/or encephalopathy.;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;

In the United States	 infection of 20% or more of ticks with _B. burgdorferi_ occurs in parts of New England	 in parts of the mid-Atlantic States	 and in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin	 but not in most other locations. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend if the infection rate in ticks in specific local areas is 20% or more	 and if an adult or nymphal _I. scapularis_ tick is estimated to have been attached for ⩾36 h on the basis of the degree of engorgement of the tick with blood or of certainty about the time of exposure to the tick	 prophylaxis with single-dose doxycycline within 72 h of the time that the tick was removed would be justified if doxycycline is not otherwise contraindicated (<https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/43/9/1089/422463>).;;;;;;;;;;

Individual hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks can be infected with more than one genospecies of the Bbsl complex	 as well as multiple other pathogens	 including _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_	 the cause of anaplasmosis (also known as human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA)	 _Babesia microti_	 the cause of babesiosis	 _Borrelia miyamotoi_	 the cause of a relapsing fever-like illness	 and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)	 the cause of tickborne encephalitis (TBE). It is	 therefore	 possible that co-infections with 2 or more of these tick-borne pathogens may occur. - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;;;

Officials in Quebec's Eastern Townships are warning of a spike in ticks carrying Lyme disease	 putting residents and visitors at high risk of exposure.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In 2021	 the number of people infected with the disease in the region doubled compared to the year before [2020] -- 387 last year compared to 157 in 2020 -- and more than half of the people infected with Lyme disease in the province contracted it in the Eastern Townships.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"This is a serious problem, and I think that the population must take it seriously,"""" said Bromont Mayor Louis Villeneuve. """"The tick is here, we have to live with it, we have to be careful."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"At a news conference held in Bromont on Thursday [3 Jun 2022], public health officials said the disease is spreading rapidly, affecting the regional county municipality of Le Granit as well as towns like Windsor and Val-des-Sources. """"These were towns that were not very affected before,"""" said Dr Geneviève Baron, a medical advisor for public health in the Eastern Townships and a member of the Canadian Lyme Disease Research Network.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is caused by bacteria entering the body through an infected tick bite and if left untreated	 can lead to long-term health problems. The most indicative symptom of Lyme disease is a circular red rash around the spot of the tick bite. Other symptoms include headache	 fever and chills	 fatigue	 aching muscles and joints	 swollen lymph nodes	 and spasms or weakness. Baron said there are antibiotics available in pharmacies to help treat the bacterial infection and avoid health complications.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The important thing is to identify it quickly because the treatment is very effective at first. In the 1st few weeks, if you are treated, it resolves easily,"""" said Baron. Tick removal tweezers will also be offered free of charge in Bromont. Public health officials are recommending that residents adopt good habits, such as wearing long-sleeved clothing in wooded areas and inspecting themselves for ticks or tick bites following outdoor activities.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There is hope that a vaccine against the disease will soon be available as Valneva and Pfizer are expected to continue clinical trials this year [2022]. Health officials are also keeping their eye on anaplasmosis	 another tick-borne disease	 which is increasingly common in the Eastern Townships. Its symptoms are similar to those of the flu	 but like Lyme disease	 it must also be treated quickly to avoid the risk of health complications.;;;;;;;;;;

The Public Health Department of Estrie confirms that 387 cases of Lyme disease were declared on the territory of the CIUSSS de l'Estrie - CHUS* in 2021	 compared to 157 in 2020. The region accounts for 55% of the 709 cases declared in Quebec.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Moreover, Estriens must now be extra vigilant as we are also seeing the appearance of anaplasmosis. In 2021, Estrie experienced the largest cluster of anaplasmosis reported in the country to date. Dr Geneviève Baron, Medical Adviser to the Public Health Department of Estrie recalls some prudent instructions: """"Considering the considerable increase in cases of Lyme disease and the appearance of anaplasmosis in Estrie, it is very important to follow prevention advice and remove the tick with fine tweezers as soon as possible, as soon as it is discovered. The risk of transmission of diseases transmitted by ticks increases with the duration of the tick attachment."""" To date, Estrie has 21 municipalities where the level of risk of acquiring Lyme disease is significant and 24 municipalities where the present risk is estimated. All regional county municipalities (MRC) in the region are affected by tick-borne diseases, with the exception of Granit.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
However	 you should know that another disease transmitted by ticks is also present in Quebec and Estrie: little known to the public	 anaplasmosis is also a disease transmitted by ticks. Its symptoms are chills	 headache	 muscle aches	 and gastrointestinal discomfort. In most people	 the symptoms of this infection are moderate or mild. However	 the elderly	 people with a weakened immune system	 or those who delay consulting after the appearance of the 1st symptoms	 can be more seriously affected and be hospitalized. People can get this disease even if they removed the tick within 24 hours of discovering it. Like Lyme disease	 this disease is treated with antibiotics	 but it is important to consult your doctor as soon as symptoms appear.;;;;;;;;;;

[Factors that could account for an increase in Lyme disease incidence in the Estrie region include climate change	 growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas	 and enlarging populations of deer	 white-footed mice	 and other small rodents	 and _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_. Nymphal _I. scapularis_ are the primary tick vector for Lyme disease in the northeastern US and southeastern Canada. Deer	 although not susceptible to Lyme disease	" supply the adult tick with a required blood meal;"" white-footed mice and other small rodents are the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. _I. scapularis_ likely traveled into Canada from endemic areas in the northeastern US by attaching themselves onto migrating mammals and birds (<https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150706143251.htm>). Ticks can only climb the short distance on vegetation to a height at which they are most likely to contact their preferred host and wait (known as """"""""questing"""""""") for a host to pass by. Nymphs quest for a blood meal at temperatures greater than 7 deg C/45 deg F (<http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long>)."";;;;;;;;;"

Tick season crawls onto the calendar from early spring to autumn. If you live in the Czech Republic	 this is important information to know as about one out of every 10 ticks is infected with some type of the 2 commonest transmittable illnesses: Lyme disease and tickborne encephalitis [TBE].;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Prevention -- wearing long sleeves and protective clothing or using tick repellant when outdoors -- and proper tick removal are important safeguards	 but vaccination is becoming an increasingly common way of preventing tickborne encephalitis (a vaccine for Lyme disease is currently in development in the United States but isn't yet approved).;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The tickborne encephalitis vaccine is usually administered during the winter months only; however	 it can be administered year-round (although winter is recommended). Canadian Medical is now implementing a fast-track vaccination program over the summertime months. In the fast-track program	 the 2nd dose is administered just 14 days after the 1st vaccine. The 3rd and final dose is given after 5-12 months.;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The fast-track tick vaccine can be administered from 6 years of age but strictly upon your pediatrician's approval. Patients seeking the vaccine should only get a jab at a time when they are healthy and haven't taken antibiotics in the previous 2 weeks. Setting aside a recovery time of 48 hours after the vaccine is necessary	 and a top-up vaccine is recommended after 3 years	 and every 5 years after that.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
From January 2022	 all people over the age of 50 (who have Czech health insurance) are entitled to free vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis. The standard price for this vaccine is around CZK 800-900 [USD 33-37]. Health insurance companies reimburse varying amounts (Czech public health insurance	 for instance	 reimburses CZK 500 [USD 20.60] to adults over 18 and CZK 700 [USD 29] for children under 18).;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Of the commonest tickborne illnesses	 2 are encephalitis and Lyme disease	 also called Lyme borreliosis. A recent study by biotech firm Protean	 which examined over 12 000 ticks	 found that 10.27% were infected with Lyme disease	 and another 2.65[%] carried the encephalitis virus.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Tick bites can cause severe health consequences. Complications from encephalitis include chronic headaches	 sleeping disorders	 issues with concentration and balance	 depression	 tremors	 and paralysis of facial muscles or limbs.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
While tickborne encephalitis is an infectious disease of viral origin and can be vaccinated against	 Lyme disease is of bacterial origin and can only be treated with antibiotics. It is often accompanied by muscle and joint pain	 headache	 fatigue	 or fever.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Anyone who's bitten by a tick and starts to experience flu-like symptoms within 4 days up to 2 weeks should see a doctor. Symptoms to be concerned about include fever	 headache	 muscle ache	 fatigue	 and malaise. Keep an eye on the site of the bite	 and if a red area with a diameter of 3-5 cm [1.2-2 in] develops	 seek immediate medical attention.;;;;;;;;;;

The proportion of ticks having TBE virus and Lyme disease bacteria is given; the number of cases so far this year (2022) is not stated.

A 2016 ProMED post indicated that although Central and Eastern Europe countries are endemic for the European subtype of TBE virus and cases occur there yearly	 cases have declined significantly in Austria and remain low in Germany	 Poland	 and Slovakia	 while remaining high in recent years in the Czech Republic (see Tick-borne encephalitis - Czech Republic (02): background 20160210.4009410).;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;

"Immunization offers the most effective protection against tickborne encephalitis.

One in 6 dogs test positive for Lyme disease in Benzie County;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
-------------------------------------------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Tick-borne diseases are becoming more of a threat to both dogs and their owners in Benzie County	 and it is only expected to get worse.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The black-legged tick	 also known as the deer tick	 (_Ixodes scapularis_) is one of several ticks in Michigan which can transmit diseases like Lyme disease	 and their habitat and instances of human encounters is increasing each year.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Tania Arens	 office manager at Betsie River Veterinary Clinic	 said veterinarians at the clinic are seeing not only an increase in animals testing positive for tick borne diseases	 but also new diseases.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
According to Arens	 out of 479 tests	 76 came back positive for Lyme disease	 48 were positive for anaplasmosis and 3 were positive for ehrlichiosis.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Both anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis are bacterial diseases transmitted from ticks to other animals	 as well as humans.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Companion Animal Parasite Council also warns tick borne illnesses are on the rise	 especially Lyme disease	 Arens said	 citing an article written in 2019.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The Companion Animal Parasite Council recently released a study showing Lyme disease is spreading to regions not previously thought to be at risk for tick-borne disease,"""" the article states. """"States such as Illinois, Iowa, North Dakota, Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia and Tennessee have all seen an increase in the prevalence of Lyme disease, according to a media release discussing the study, which the council conducted from January 2012 to December 2016.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Arens said 1 in 8 dogs testing positive had more than one tick-borne illness.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We also had an employee's dog which has never left the state test positive for Rocky Mountain spotted fever,"""" she said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Ticks can also transmit these diseases to humans	 Arens said	 and where dogs are being infected	 humans are too. However	 dogs cannot transmit the disease to people.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We've had several clients who have recently been treated for Lyme disease, and it has happened before,"""" she said. """"We had one client who shared she had been feeling ill but her doctor couldn't find out why. She had some tests which were sent to the Mayo Clinic and it turned out she had anaplasmosis, which can cause anemia, low platelet count and even disorientation and a type of dementia."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Arens said anybody who has been bitten by a tick is at risk of contracting a disease	 and it is possible for a bite to go undetected.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Sometimes ticks have to feed for a certain period of time to transmit the disease, like Lyme disease,"""" she said. """"Other diseases can be transmitted after a few hours."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Arens said doctors don't often test for tick borne illnesses	 and symptoms can be vague	 leading many people to go undiagnosed and their cases unreported.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We're doing a better job diagnosing it in pets than we are in people,"""" she said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The diseases can be hard to diagnose in pets as well.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lyme disease presents as elevated temperature, lethargy and sometimes a lameness in a limb,"""" Arens said. """"That lameness can be in one limb one day, and another the next."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
She said dogs don't show a bullseye rash at the bite mark like humans sometimes do.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"They've generally got stiff joints and they're not feeling good,"""" Arens said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Both anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis also present as lethargy	 but can cause more serious problems than Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"They also can cause anemia and keep blood from clotting like it should,"""" she said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Preventing tick bites is the best way to avoid disease in both pets and humans	 Arens said.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We're recommending a 2-fold approach: an oral control and something topical,"""" she said. """"The oral medication metabolizes in the body and kills ticks causing the bite. Usually, the medication works fast enough to prevent the transmission of diseases like Lyme disease. However, the tick still has to bite."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Arens said oral treatments might not be a good fit for dogs with a history of or predisposition for seizures	 as the class of drugs they use can lower the seizure threshold.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Topical treatments	 like tick repelling collars	 keep the pests off pets in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"This protects pets against diseases that transmit faster,"""" Arens said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
She also said dogs should be on tick treatment all year	 as tick populations are becoming active year-round.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"There is not winter freeze anymore which kills them,"""" Arens said. """"We're pulling ticks off dogs in January."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Those looking for natural remedies may be out of luck for now. Arens said there are no known natural remedies proven to prevent tick bites or repel them.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We've heard of a few things which might work, like citronella or certain essential oils, but it is anecdotal,"""" she said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Controlling ticks in the environment is the most effective natural way to prevent bites to pets and humans	 according to Arens.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"As for cats, Arens said they are """"magical creatures"""" who seem to be immune to tick borne illnesses -- at least for now. ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"They don't seem to be affected so far, but we don't know if it is because they are avid groomers or if it is because of their biology,"""" she said. """"It could be they just don't exhibit signs;"" dogs and cats are affected by different things in different ways."""""""""";;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Arens warned a popular repellant for human use	 permethrin	 could be dangerous to cats	 and felines should be kept away from areas where permethrin is being applied and the clothing it has been applied to until it dries. ;;;;;;;;;;

[Cats are extremely sensitive to some chemicals and to essential oils. Please do not treat your feline friend with any product until the veterinarian has been consulted. Cats metabolize things differently than other animals and application of a dog product can easily kill your cat or kitten.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Ticks are on the move	 and generally it is year round. They seem to be spreading and bringing with them a host of nasty diseases. Tick prevention is a year round process. Do not be late in treating your pet. A one-day difference in application can make the difference of preventing disease and your dog being infected by the disease. ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Be very cautious of using anything not recommended by your veterinarian. While some essential oils may be beneficial our pets are much more sensitive to essential oils	 and some have resulted in death of the pet. ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
While there are many choices in the pet store	 your best and safest option is what your veterinarian recommends. While a product can state it kills ticks	 it may not be the variety of tick you have in your area. So please see your veterinarian for the best recommendation.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Ticks can and do bite cats	 dogs	 horses	 cattle and of course	 these animals' owners and care givers. Depending upon the specific tick and disease	 there can be disease transmission in a very short time	 to you and to your animals. The size of the host animal does not matter to ticks	 so be sure you are taking care of your horses	 cow and other animals as well.;;;;;;;;;;																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Remember	 ticks can transmit a variety of disease	 such as Lyme disease	 anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis	 and others.;;;;;;;;;;

According to Kahl	 the months from March to July are the months with the strongest tick activity on average over many years.

"Kahl also advises that it is best to visit a toilet again before visiting the forest, because stepping out in the forest may be a special risk situation as far as tick bites are concerned.

[Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere	 occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America	 Europe	 and Asia. It is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete	 _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex	 a genetically diverse group of spirochetes (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3167092/>). Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks	 and various small- and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The species of tick	 the host species	 borrelial genospecies	 and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. The patterns of disease also differ by geographical location. For example	 acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and neuroborreliosis are more common in Europe	 whereas arthritis appears to be prevalent in the United States.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
At least 3 species of the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex (_B. afzelii_	 _B. garinii_	 and _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto) are known to cause Lyme disease in humans	 although _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the most common pathogenic species to cause Lyme disease in North America. It also occurs in Europe	 but is less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_	 the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Individual ticks can be infected with more than one genospecies of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex. In Europe	 _B. burgdorferi_ genospecies that cause Lyme borreliosis are mainly transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. In a literature review of studies of the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato in _I. ricinus_ ticks in various European countries	 the overall mean prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_-infected ticks was 13.7% (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/>): Regions with the highest infection rates are located in central Europe (Austria	 Czech Republic	 southern Germany	 Switzerland	 Slovakia	 and Slovenia); The infection rate in adult ticks (18.6%) was considerably higher infection rate than in nymphs (10.1%). In Switzerland	 13.6 to 49% of ticks were infected. In the Austria/Switzerland region	 of positive ticks	 25% were infected with _B. afzelii_	 44% with _B. garinii_	 and 25% with _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto. No significant difference was seen when the prevalence of each _Borrelia_ species in nymphs was compared to that in adults (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/>). ;;;;;;;;;													
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Since _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 the cause of Lyme disease	 _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_	 the cause of anaplasmosis (also known as human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA)	 _Babesia microti_	 the cause of babesiosis	 _Borrelia miyamotoi_	 the cause of a relapsing fever-like illness	 and tick-borne encephalitis virus or TBEV	 the cause of tick-borne encephalitis or TBE	 are all transmitted by the same hard-bodied _Ixodes_ tick species (_I. ricinus_) in the same geographic locations in Europe	 it is possible that co-infections with 2 or more of these tick-borne pathogens may occur. ;;;;;;;;;;														
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
TBE is an important vaccine-preventable viral zoonosis that has been reported to be increasing in Europe (please see ProMED post Tick-borne encephalitis - France (03): (AR) raw cheese	 context 20200619.7486311)	 as has Lyme disease (<https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/246167/Fact-sheet-Lyme-borreliosis-Eng.pdf>). TBE is caused by a flavivirus (tickborne encephalitis virus or TBEV). There are 3 main subtypes of TBEV (European	 Siberian	 and Far East)	 the European subtype being transmitted mainly by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_ (_I. persulcatus_ transmitting the other subtypes). Food transmission through the consumption of unpasteurized milk or dairy products from an infected ruminant can also occur.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
_Borrelia miyamotoi_ has been reported to occur infrequently in clinical human cases throughout Europe	 consistent with its low prevalence in _Ixodes ricinus_ ticks (<https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-018-2713-z>). ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Typically	 the nymph stage of the tick	 which is about the size of a poppy seed	 transmits these diseases. For a picture of the nymph	 see <http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/>. - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;;;

Abstract;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
--------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Background;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus is a human pathogen that is expanding its endemic zones in Europe	 emerging in previously unaffected regions. In Austria	 increasing incidence in alpine regions in the west has been countered by a decline in traditional endemic areas to the east of the country.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Aim;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
To shed light on the cause of this disparity	 we compared the temporal changes of human TBE incidences in all federal provinces of Austria with those of Lyme borreliosis (LB)	 which has the same tick vector and rodent reservoir.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Methods;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
This comparative analysis was based on the surveillance of hospitalised TBE cases by the National Reference Center for TBE and on the analysis of hospitalised LB cases from hospital discharge records across all of Austria from 2005 to 2018.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Results;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The incidences of the 2 diseases and their annual fluctuations were not geographically concordant. Neither the decline in TBE in the eastern lowlands nor the increase in western alpine regions is paralleled by similar changes in the incidence of LB.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Conclusion;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The discrepancy between changes in incidence of TBE and LB supports the contributions of virus-specific factors beyond the mere availability of tick vectors and/or human outdoor activity	 which are a prerequisite for the transmission of both diseases. A better understanding of parameters controlling human pathogenicity and the maintenance of TBE virus in its natural vector-host cycle will generate further insights into the focal nature of TBE and can potentially improve forecasts of TBE risk on smaller regional scales.;;;;;;;;;;

[It is clear that in this study the geographic location where tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme disease (LD) were acquired was assumed to be within the federal provinces where the patients reside. However	 for both LD and TBE	 it is important to obtain a thorough travel history from patients	 as these diseases may be acquired in endemic areas other than where they reside	 and knowing the proportion that travel-related LD and TBE accounts for the documented cases is important. Nevertheless	 even though questionnaires were sent to the treating physicians in the hospitals that requested information on the possible geographical site of infection	 we are not told to what extent this information matched the location of the patient's residence.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Also	 the study involved only hospitalized patients with TBE and LD. Only a minority of patients with LD require hospitalization. In the US	 about 2800 patients with LD were hospitalized	 usually because of carditis	 arthritis	 or neurologic involvement	 between 2005 and 2014 (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7521202/>). Thus	 only about 1% of the about 30 000 cases of LD reported each year (<https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/index.html>)	 are hospitalized in the US and perhaps in Austria. Thus	 the observed findings in incidence rates of LD in Austria likely apply to only a very small fraction of all LD patients.;;;;;;;;;;																
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
However	 a much larger portion (20-30%) of patients with TBE develop central nervous system involvement	 with symptoms of meningitis	 encephalitis	 or meningoencephalitis	 that likely require hospitalization. As pointed out by the investigators of this study	 the falling incidence of TBE is unlikely to be caused by TBE virus strains circulating in eastern Austria that have acquired mutations that reduce transmission or pathogenicity for humans	 and thus reduce the frequency of hospitalization. - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;;;

This report raises some critical questions: was the prevalence of TBE virus in vector ticks constant over the years	 including in those localities where the incidence of human TBE cases declined? Was TBE virus vector the tick population in these areas decreasing	 stable	 or increasing? Was the proportion of the population vaccinated against TBE increasing in localities where hospitalized TBE patients were decreasing?

;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is rebounding in Maine this year [2022]	 with the number of cases so far this year [14 Aug 2022] on pace to exceed the totals for 2020 and 2021.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Maine recorded 1433 Lyme cases through [14 Aug 2022]	 compared with 1127 in all of 2020 and 1510 in all of 2021	 according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention [<https://www.pressherald.com/2021/03/22/lyme-disease-cases-fell-sharply-in-2020-with-covid-19-and-weather-likely-playing-a-role/>]. And the deer ticks that cause Lyme will actively search for hosts well into the autumn before becoming less active and burrowing beneath leaf litter for the winter.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The increase in cases this year [2022] comes despite the dry summer in much of the state. Warm	 humid	 and rainy weather brings out ticks	 while dry weather is not as favorable for the arachnids.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Griffin Dill	 integrated pest management professional for the University of Maine Cooperative Extension's tick lab	 said it's difficult to determine what is causing the increase in Lyme cases this year [2022]	 but several factors may be at work.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"A rainy late spring and early summer may have contributed. Dill said even with mostly dry conditions in July and August, the ticks may have been better poised to survive a dry spell after the near-ideal weather conditions earlier this year. """"The adult ticks in spring and early summer were highly active,"""" Dill said. """"It started to tail off at the end of June, early July."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Dill said another factor may be that a higher percentage of deer ticks are carrying the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. The lab accepts tick samples from all over the state to test for infectious diseases, and the percentage of ticks found to be carrying the bacteria increased from 38 percent in 2019 to 45 percent so far this year [2022]. """"We have more ticks testing positive for the pathogens than in previous years,"""" Dill said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The range of deer ticks also keeps expanding into new parts of the state, he said. """"We are starting to see more of an increase in Down East, in Washington County, as far east as Calais,"""" Dill said. """"The habitat along the coast is more conducive to ticks."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Cases of another tick-borne disease called anaplasmosis also are tracking higher this year	 with 610 cases through [14 Aug 2022]	 compared to 841 for all of 2021. Maine has reported 97 cases of babesiosis	 the other disease most commonly associated with deer ticks	 so far this year [2022].;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lyme disease peaked in Maine in 2019, with 2167 total cases, before falling off to 1127 cases in 2020. Dill said it's difficult to tell why cases were so much lower in 2020, but it may be that there were many undiagnosed cases during the 1st year of the COVID-19 pandemic. """"Many people were not seeking medical attention in 2020,"""" he said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Meanwhile, scientists, including some in Maine, are testing a Lyme vaccine that soon could be approved. Pfizer is currently conducting human clinical trials for a Lyme vaccine, and Brewer-based Northern Light Health in Maine is the site of one of the trials. Kris Currier, a Northern Light Health spokeswoman, said the health care system """"will soon share more information about a Lyme disease vaccine trial that was recently addressed in the news. We anticipate approval to begin enrollment in September [2022] and will send out information including dates and the process for enrollment when details are confirmed."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme can be treated with a course of antibiotics. But many cases go undetected	 especially if people are bitten by ticks in the nymphal stage	 which are so tiny they can be hard to spot. Symptoms of Lyme disease can include fatigue	 joint pain	 headache	 and fever. If untreated	 Lyme disease can cause heart and nervous system conditions.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dill said the tick lab is studying the role of the white-footed mouse as a reservoir for Lyme disease. The white-footed mouse is more prevalent in southern Maine but may be expanding its habitat. Dill said it's unknown if the deer mouse	 a more common mouse in northern Maine	 is less likely to be a reservoir for Lyme than the white-footed mouse. He said it's also unclear if the white-footed mouse is expanding its habitat farther north and displacing the deer mouse.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Meanwhile, the Maine Medical Center Research Institute is conducting several research projects, including """"investigating ways to eliminate Lyme disease at its source by preventing ticks from spreading the Lyme bacteria in the wild"""" and also studying how temperature and humidity impact the survivability of deer ticks.;;;;;;;;;;"

Communicated by:;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
ProMED Rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
[An increased incidence of Lyme disease	 anaplasmosis	 and babesiosis can be due to a true increase in the number of cases as the primary vector and the reservoir hosts expand locally or spread geographically into previously uninvolved regions	 but also better recognition and reporting of these diseases may contribute to the increases in the number of reported cases.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Factors that could account for a true increase in the incidence of these tick-borne diseases in the US State of Maine include climate change	 growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas	 and enlarging populations of deer	 white-footed mice	 and other small rodents	 and _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_. Nymphal _I. scapularis_ are the primary tick vector for these diseases in the northeastern US and southeastern Canada. Deer	 although not susceptible to Lyme disease	 supply the adult tick with a required blood meal and they they are responsible for transporting ticks; white-footed mice and other small rodents are the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"_I. scapularis_ likely traveled from endemic areas in the northeastern US by attaching themselves onto migrating mammals and birds (<https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150706143251.htm>). Deer ticks by themselves unlikely travel far;"" travel over greater distances is achieved by the ticks' attaching themselves to migrating mammals and birds. Ticks can only climb the short distance on vegetation to a height at which they are most likely to contact their preferred host and wait (known as """"""""questing"""""""") for a host to pass by. Nymphs quest for a blood meal at temperatures greater than 7 deg C/45 deg F (<http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long>)."";;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A photo of the characteristic rash of early Lyme disease can be found at <http://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lyme_disease_picture/picture.htm>.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In the US	 _I. scapularis_ can transmit simultaneously one or more of the following pathogens: _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (the spirochete that causes Lyme disease)	 _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (a bacterium that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA)	 _Borrelia miyamotoi_ (a spirochete that causes a relapsing fever-like illness)	 _Babesia microti_ (the protozoan that causes babesiosis)	 and Powassan virus (a virus that causes encephalitis)	 (<https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00142/full>). For a picture of the tick nymph	 see <http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/>.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A prevalence of 45% of deer ticks carrying the bacterium that causes Lyme disease is high	 and means that there are many infected white-footed mice (_Peromyscus leucopus_) on which ticks fed. White-footed mice are the reservoir of _B. burgdorferi_.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Decreased rainfall in the summer months in Maine could have reduced the questing nymph tick population	 because nymph ticks require a high humidity of more than 85 percent (<http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long>)	 forcing them to move down the vegetation into more humid leaf litter on the ground to maintain hydration during summer drought conditions.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The increased incidence of Lyme disease and anaplasmosis in Maine could be due to an increase in the number of questing infected tick vectors during a wet fall season. Because nymphs quest for a blood meal at temperatures greater than 7 deg C/45 deg F (<http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long>)	 the local daytime temperatures in the fall season would have to be above this value. In fact	 daytime temperatures are mostly above 7 deg C/45 deg F in September and October in Maine (<https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Maine/temperature-october.php>).;;;;;;;;;;

"The term """"Down East"""" within Maine refers specifically to the state's easternmost coastal regions that covers Washington County and Hancock County, beginning in Ellsworth and stretching to the East all the way to the Canadian Maritime Provinces (<https://umaine.edu/undiscoveredmaine/downeast-maine/>).;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
It should be noted that cases are reported by county of residence	 which is assumed to be the county of exposure. But people are often exposed to infected ticks outside their county of residence. - Mod.ML];;;;;;;;;;

[Professors Karin Stiasny (KS)	 and Franz X Heinz (FH) responded to comments made by Mods. ML and TY to their report on tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease in Austria (see Tick-borne encephalitis & Lyme disease - Austria: 2005-18 20210908.8653379). Their comments (KS	 FH) follow the comments made by Mods. ML and TY];;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
KS	FH: We thank you for your interest in our paper and its thorough analysis. A few aspects addressed in your comments can be clarified as follows:;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Mod.ML: It is clear that in this study the geographic location where tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme disease (LD) were acquired was assumed to be within the federal provinces where the patients reside. However	 for both LD and TBE	 it is important to obtain a thorough travel history from patients	 as these diseases may be acquired in endemic areas other than where they reside and knowing the proportion that travel-related LD and TBE accounts for the documented cases is important. Nevertheless	 even though questionnaires were sent to the treating physicians in the hospitals that requested information on the possible geographical site of infection	 we are not told to what extent this information matched the location of the patient's residence.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
KS	FH: As deduced from the questionnaires returned to the National Reference Laboratory	 probable sites of TBE virus infection (that is	 those cases for which reliable information was obtained) matched the location of the patients' places of residence at the level of Federal Provinces by 98%. Since the requirements for transmission (tick bites	 outdoor activities) are identical for both TBE and LD	 it is justified to assume that this number is similar for LD. In addition	 travel histories can be expected to be similar for TBE and LD patients.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
We are sorry for not having included this important information in the manuscript	 and we are grateful for pointing to this omission. We have also sent this information to the Journal.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Mod.ML: Also	 the study involved only hospitalized patients with TBE and LD. Only a minority of patients with LD require hospitalization. In the US	 about 2800 patients with LD were hospitalized	 usually because of carditis	 arthritis	 or neurologic involvement	 between 2005 and 2014 (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7521202/>). Thus	 only about 1% of the about 30 000 cases of LD reported each year (<https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/index.html>)	 are hospitalized in the US and perhaps in Austria. Thus	 the observed findings in incidence rates of LD in Austria likely apply to only a very small fraction of all LD patients.;;;;;;;;;;																
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
However	 a much larger portion (20-30%) of patients with TBE develop central nervous system involvement	 with symptoms of meningitis	 encephalitis	 or meningoencephalitis	 that likely require hospitalization. As pointed out by the investigators of this study	 the falling incidence of TBE is unlikely to be caused by TBE virus strains circulating in eastern Austria that have acquired mutations that reduce transmission or pathogenicity for humans	 and thus reduce the frequency of hospitalization.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
KS	FH: It is correct that we analyzed only hospitalized patients of LD and TBE	 that is	 only the tip of an iceberg of a much larger number of infections not leading to hospitalization (see the end of Introduction	 page 3; <https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.35.2002108>). The proportion of the tip to the rest of the iceberg may differ between the 2 infections; the percentage of symptomatic TBE virus infections has been estimated to be in the range of 2-30% (Bogovic and Strle. Tick-borne encephalitis: A review of epidemiology	 clinical characteristics	 and management. World J Clin Cases. 2015. 3(5): 430-41; <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419106/>) or even as low as 1% (Suess J. Tick-borne encephalitis 2010: Epidemiology	 risk areas	 and virus strains in Europe and Asia -- An overview. Ticks Tick Borne Dis. 2011; 2(1): 2-15; <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2010.10.007>). Such differences	 however	 would not change the major result and important conclusion of the study	 since hospitalized patients with both TBE and LD were infected by tick bites during outdoor activities.;;;;;														
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Mod.TY: This report raises some critical questions: was the prevalence of TBE virus in vector ticks constant over the years	 including in those localities where the incidence of human TBE cases declined? Was TBE virus vector the tick population in these areas decreasing	 stable	 or increasing? Was the proportion of the population vaccinated against TBE increasing in localities where hospitalized TBE patients were decreasing?;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
KS	FH responded: To exclude any vaccination-associated effects we included only cases in unvaccinated individuals in our study (Methods page 3: calculation of incidence rates; Results	 page 5: 1st paragraph)	 that is	 the changes observed are not influenced by the obvious decline of the overall incidences through vaccination	 as documented previously (Heinz et al	 Emerging Infectious Diseases 2013 and Eurosurveillance 2015).;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Mod.TY concluded: Had TBE virus transmission efficiency of vector ticks changed over time in any of the localities? Is that efficiency altered for local TBE virus strains with increasing temperature?;;;;;;;;;;

Nebraska has never had a case of Lyme disease confirmed to be contracted within the state -- until now. Officials with Nebraska's Department of Health and Human Services say 2 cases of Lyme disease were recently confirmed in Thurston County.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is an infection caused by specific bacteria from the bite of an infected tick. Its symptoms are very mild at first but can get increasingly worse if the infection spreads to the heart	 the nervous system	 or the joints.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Both people contracted Lyme disease around the same time and near the same place. That sent researchers in multiple health departments to the area for a full environmental investigation. They collected blacklegged ticks from areas where they think the two people were exposed. Those ticks were sent off to labs at Creighton University and the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Disease where they tested positive for _Borrelia burgdorferi_-- the bacteria that causes Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Officials say it's the 1st definitive evidence a case of Lyme disease was contracted within Nebraska. But they say it doesn't mean the bacterium isn't already spreading and established among Nebraska's tick population. With the colder weather setting in	 most ticks aren't as large of a concern	 but blacklegged ticks are still active even in the colder weather.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Your best bet to avoiding Lyme disease is avoiding ticks in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Tips from DHHS:;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 picaridin	 IR3535	 oil of lemon eucalyptus	 para-menthane-diol	 or 2-undecanone;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 pants	 socks	 and tents with products containing 0.5% permethrin;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 pants	 and socks when outside;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
- do frequent tick checks after being outdoors and remove attached ticks promptly with fine-tipped tweezers. Don't forget to check pets for ticks after being outdoors as well;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NOM?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Ticks are generally found near the ground, in brushy or wooded areas. They cannot jump or fly. Instead, they climb grasses or shrubs and wait for you to brush against them. This is called """"questing"""". When this happens, they hang on to you with small claws and then find a spot to attach and take a blood meal.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
What to do if you find a tick on you:;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 as close to the skin as possible	 and pull it straight out. Early removal can minimize and often eliminate the chance of infection. After removing the tick	 thoroughly clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol or soap and water;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 petroleum jelly	 or heat to make the tick detach from the skin. These methods are not effective and may increase the risk of disease transmission;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 and see a healthcare provider if these develop. Be sure to let your healthcare provider know you were recently bitten by a tick.;;;;;;;;;;

[Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States and is caused in the US by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and rarely	 _B. mayonii_.The white-footed mouse is the reservoir in nature and it is transmitted to humans by the bite of a hard-bodied tick	 _Ixodes scapularis_	 commonly known as the deer tick	 in the northeastern US and upper midwestern US and _I. pacificus_ along the Pacific coast. About 30 000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the CDC each year in the US. However	 the CDC estimates that the actual number of cases is more than 10-fold higher (<https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Flyme%2Fstats%2Findex.html>). Most cases are reported by week of disease onset in June-August	 but cases are still reported in late November-December (<https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/charts-figures-recent.html>).;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The geographic distribution of areas with a high incidence of Lyme disease appears to be expanding	 based on data from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS); the number of counties with an incidence of ≥10 confirmed cases per 100 000 persons increased from 324 in 2008 to 432 in 2019 (<https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/recent-surveillance-data.html>). Nebraska and all its surrounding states reported cases of Lyme disease in 2019	 but that does not necessarily mean that Lyme disease was acquired in that state; people travel between states	 and reporting is by state of residence	 not the place where the disease was actually acquired (<https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/maps-recent.html>).;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
Nebraska (pop.	 1.9 million residents in 2020) is a state in the midwestern region of the United States	 bordered by South Dakota to the north; Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast; Kansas to the south; Colorado to the southwest; and Wyoming to the west.

;;;;;;;;;;																									
In recent months	 far less attention has been paid to another widespread problem that has been proliferating since the late 1970s: Lyme disease. Lyme disease is the most reported vector-borne disease in the country. Over the past 20 years	 the United States has experienced a dramatic increase in both the number of reported cases and the geographic distribution of the disease.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"In Virginia, the disease is transmitted by blacklegged ticks, which are infected with the Lyme disease-causing bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_. Virginia Tech Assistant Professor Brandon Jutras and his lab have continued to tackle the Lyme disease epidemic over the past year, and they have recently identified another missing piece of the Lyme disease puzzle, the university announced in a news release. """"This discovery furthers our understanding of how _Borrelia burgdorferi_ causes inflammation and disease,"""" said Mari Davis, the research lab's lead author. """"It is a testament to how unique that this bacterium is -- and how we need to keep working to understand more about what is going on behind the scenes in order to develop future diagnostics and treatments."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Almost all bacteria	 including the Lyme disease-causing bacterium	 make a mesh-like bag to protect the inside of their cells. This bag is known as peptidoglycan. In 2019	 Jutras identified peptidoglycan	 a lingering cell wall component of the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 as a likely culprit of the inflammation and Lyme arthritis	 the most common late-stage symptom of Lyme disease. Jutras' previous research has shown that peptidoglycan in _Borrelia burgdorferi_ lingers in the bodies of Lyme arthritis patients after the bacteria has entered the body. Weeks to months after the initial infection	 the peptidoglycan remains	 inciting inflammation and pain.;;;;;;;;;;																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In this newest development	 the lab discovered a protein associated with the peptidoglycan of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ that plays an amplifying role in causing inflammation in Lyme arthritis patients by acting as a molecular beacon that antagonizes the patients' immune system. Using an unbiased proteomics approach and The Mass Spectrometry Research Incubator (VT-MSI) from the Fralin Life Sciences Institute's Core Services	 the team identified the protein to be NapA.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"NapA, which stands for neutrophil attracting protein A, is an immunomodulatory molecule that is able to recruit immune cells, called neutrophils, toward the inflammatory peptidoglycan. """"NapA is another piece to an ever-evolving puzzle;"" it seems to play a basic role in everyday bacterial life by helping the overall protective properties of peptidoglycan"	 but it moonlights as a devious protein capable of tricking our immune system	""" said Jutras. """"""""We believe NapA's devious side has 2 modes: Early in infection"	 when bacteria are dying and releasing NapA and peptidoglycan	 it acts as a decoy to attract immune cells	 which allows the viable bacteria to escape and cause disease. In later stages of disease	 it may act to attract immune cells to peptidoglycan	 a molecule capable of causing inflammation and arthritis	""" Jutras said."";;;;;;;;;"																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
To determine how NapA attracted neutrophils	 Davis sought out Caroline Jones	 assistant professor in the Department of Biological Sciences in the Virginia Tech College of Science at the time of the discovery. Her lab specializes in the study of neutrophil chemoattraction. Jones placed neutrophils in the middle of a microfluidic chip	 which acts as a maze that cells can wander through. On one side of the chip	 there was pure peptidoglycan; on the other was peptidoglycan with NapA. The Jones and Jutras labs showed that neutrophils rapidly migrate toward the side with NapA	 proving that the protein is able to give off chemical signals that attract neutrophils in the direction of it	 and peptidoglycan.;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"With this new piece to the puzzle in hand, Jutras plans to add to the lab's current efforts to improve the diagnostic testing and treatment of Lyme disease. """"From a prevention and diagnostic perspective, it's possible that the combination of peptidoglycan and NapA could be a novel target for diagnostics,"""" Jutras said. """"It could, in theory, be a possible avenue of vaccine development as well. These are big picture possibilities that we are actively pursuing. One thing that we know for sure is that this finding furthers our understanding of how peptidoglycan can drive Lyme arthritis patient [symptomatology]."""";;;;;;;;;;"

Abstract;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
--------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The bacterial pathogen responsible for causing Lyme disease, _Borrelia burgdorferi_, is an atypical Gram-negative spirochete that is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infected _Ixodes_ tick. In diderms [having 2 cell membranes], peptidoglycan (PG) is sandwiched between the inner and outer membrane of the cell envelope. In many other Gram-negative bacteria, PG is bound by protein(s), which provide both structural integrity and continuity between envelope layers. Here, we present evidence of a peptidoglycan-associated protein (PAP) in _B. burgdorferi_. Using an unbiased proteomics approach, we identified neutrophil attracting protein A (NapA) as a PAP. Interestingly, NapA is a Dps [DNA binding protein from starved bacteria] homologue, which typically functions to bind and protect cellular DNA from damage during times of stress. While _B. burgdorferi_ NapA is known to be involved in the oxidative stress response, it lacks the critical residues necessary for DNA binding. Biochemical and cellular studies demonstrate that NapA is localized to the _B. burgdorferi_ periplasm and is indeed a PAP. Cryo-electron microscopy indicates that mutant bacteria, unable to produce NapA, have structural abnormalities. Defects in cell-wall integrity impact growth rate and cause the napA mutant to be more susceptible to osmotic and PG-specific stresses. NapA-linked PG is secreted in outer membrane vesicles and augments IL-17 production, relative to PG alone. Using microfluidics, we demonstrate that NapA acts as a molecular beacon -- exacerbating the pathogenic properties of _B. burgdorferi_ PG. These studies further our understanding of the _B. burgdorferi_ cell envelope, provide critical information that underlies its pathogenesis, and highlight how a highly conserved bacterial protein can evolve mechanistically, while maintaining biological function."""";;;;;;;;;;"

Author summary;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
--------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Diderms typically produce peptidoglycan-associated proteins (PAPs) to enhance structural integrity and continuity within the cell envelope. We have identified a PAP in _B. burgdorferi_ with structural and sequence homology to the near ubiquitous bacterial protein Dps (DNA binding protein from starved bacteria). The _B. burgdorferi_ Dps paralogue is incapable of binding DNA. Instead, it bolsters the protective properties of the PG layer, while playing an important role in host immune modulation. Collectively, our findings highlight the plasticity of bacterial proteins in that they may change how they perform a task despite maintaining the same basic biological function."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
After transmission from an infected tick to a human host	 _B. burgdorferi_ causes an initial acute	 localized infection at the site of the tick bite with a characteristic bullseye-like rash (erythema migrans). Untreated	 Lyme disease can progress to later-stage complications that affect many tissues and organ systems	 including joints. Persistence of arthritis in some patients is thought to be due to an immune reaction to _B. burgdorferi_-derived components after the spirochetes have been killed. _B. burgdorferi_ shed peptidoglycan	 a major component of the cell wall	 into its environment during growth	 rather than being recycled during bacterial cell-wall turnover. The Jutras group previously identified the _B. burgdorferi_ peptidoglycan	 as the immunogen likely to contribute to inflammation during infection and in cases of postinfectious Lyme arthritis (<https://www.pnas.org/content/116/27/13498>). Now	 this group in the referenced journal article above identified a peptidoglycan-associated protein that attracts neutrophils	 called neutrophil attracting protein A (NapA)	 as contributing to the inflammatory response. - Mod.ML];;;;;;;;;;

Doctors in Oregon have described what might be one of the unluckiest encounters between man and tick ever documented. They report treating a 70-year-old man who became sick with 3 entirely different infections after a single tick bite.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
According to a recent case study	 published last month [April 2021] in BMJ Case Reports [<https://casereports.bmj.com/content/14/4/e241004>]	 the man visited an emergency room with symptoms of fever	 nausea	 and a distinct swelling around his ankle along with leg pain. Tests showed that he had anemia (a low red blood cell count) and thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count)	 as well as acute kidney injury and possible liver damage.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The man told doctors that a month earlier he had noticed a bite on the same ankle -- presumed to have been caused by an insect. The bite had appeared following a trip to the Northeastern US	 leading doctors to suspect that it was actually caused by a disease-carrying tick (an 8-legged arachnid). When further blood tests arrived	 though	 even they were surprised by the results. The man not only tested positive for _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 the cause of Lyme disease	 but also the bacteria _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ and _Babesia microti_	 the causes of anaplasmosis and babesiosis	 respectively.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lyme showing up at the same time as another tick-borne infection is fairly common since ticks are routinely chock full of germs. But """"infection with 3 tickborne illnesses at one time is relatively rare,"""" the doctors wrote.;;;;;;;;;;"

[Since _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 the cause of Lyme disease	 _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_	 the cause of anaplasmosis (also known as human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA)	 _Babesia microti_	 the cause of babesiosis	 _Borrelia miyamotoi_	 the cause of a relapsing fever-like illness	 and Powassan virus	 the cause of an encephalitis	 are all transmitted by the same hard-bodied _Ixodes_ tick species (_I. scapularis_) in the same geographic locations of North America	 it is possible that co-infections with two or more of these tick-borne pathogens may occur. Typically	 the nymph stage of the tick	 which is about the size of a poppy seed	 transmits these diseases. For a picture of the nymph	 see <http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/>. Various small and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts.;;;;;;;;;;										
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere	 occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America	 Europe	 and Asia. It is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete	 _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato group. The species of tick	 the host species	 borrelial genospecies	 and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the main pathogenic species identified in North America. It also occurs in Europe but is less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_	 the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies. All are present in the United Kingdom (UK)	 and _B. garinii_ appears to be the most prevalent pathogenic genospecies in most endemic areas of that country (<https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(11)00072-7/fulltext>).;;;;;;;;;;																
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Illness onset in Infected persons who are symptomatic with anaplasmosis occurs 5-21 days after a bite from an infected tick. Initial presentation typically includes sudden onset of fever	 headache	 malaise	 and myalgia	 often accompanied by thrombocytopenia	 leukopenia	 and elevated liver transaminases. Approximately 5 to 7 percent of patients require intensive care	 and the disease can be fatal. Severe infections can include prolonged fever	 shock	 confusion	 seizures	 pneumonitis	 renal failure	 hemorrhages	 and death.;;;;;;;;;;											
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The presence of hemolytic anemia suggests babesiosis. Some patients also have splenomegaly	 hepatomegaly	 or jaundice. Severe cases can be associated with marked thrombocytopenia	 disseminated intravascular coagulation	 hemodynamic instability	 acute respiratory distress	 myocardial infarction	 renal failure	 hepatic compromise	 altered mental status	 and death.;;;;;;;;;;															
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Their diagnoses are based on specific antibody tests	 detection of specific nucleic acid (DNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)	 and microscopy of thick and thin blood films. In babesiosis	 manual (non-automated) review of Wright-stained peripheral blood smears or buffy-coat preparations can demonstrate intraerythrocytic ring forms. Sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between _Babesia_ and _Plasmodium_ (especially _P. falciparum_) parasites. Cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of vacuolar microcolonies of _A. phagocytophilum_ within neutrophils can be found in 20 to 80 percent of patients with anaplasmosis	 unlike the rarity of visualizing organisms within circulating mononuclear cells in patients with human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (Weinberg G: Laboratory diagnosis of ehrlichiosis and babesiosis. Pediat Infect Dis J 2001; 20(4): 435-7; <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11332670/>).;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Because _A. phagocytophilum_ and _B. microti_ are found in the bloodstream	 infected blood can serve as a vehicle for person-to-person transmission (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _A. phagocytophilum_ transmitted through blood transfusion -- Minnesota	 2007. MMWR 2008; 57(42): 1145-8 [date cited]; <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5742a1.htm>).;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally or intravenously for 10 days for all symptomatic patients suspected of having anaplasmosis is recommended for a minimum total course of 10 days. This treatment regimen should be adequate therapy for patients with anaplasmosis alone and for patients who are co-infected with Lyme disease but is not an effective therapy for patients who are co-infected with _B. microti_.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Most asymptomatic persons with babesiosis do not require treatment. For ill patients	 babesiosis is treated for at least 7-10 days with a combination of either: atovaquone plus azithromycin	 or clindamycin plus quinine (this combination is the standard of care for severely ill patients). - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
Nearly 40% of Maine deer ticks submitted to the University of Maine Tick Lab in 2019 tested positive for Lyme disease	 according to the lab's 1st tick surveillance annual report. A smaller percentage tested positive for _Anaplasma_ and _Babesia_	 2 other causes of common tick-borne diseases.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In addition to providing information about the prevalence of tick-borne diseases in Maine	 the report gives a picture of where and when people are encountering ticks throughout the state.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"This will serve as a sort of baseline to make comparisons as we move forward, to see how fast [ticks] are spreading and establishing new populations throughout Maine,"""" said Griffin Dill, who manages the Tick Lab, located in the new UMaine Cooperative Extension Diagnostic and Research Laboratory in Orono.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
This is a first-of-its-kind study for Maine. With additional data points in future years	 it will give researchers a clearer look at the ticks roaming Maine	 the types of diseases they carry and how this could impact Maine residents. They will also be able to see how tick populations and risks vary from year to year	 allowing for better predictions of tick season outcomes.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The new report summarizes information that was gathered by the lab in 2019	 which is the 1st year that the lab accepted tick samples from the public to test for tick-borne pathogens. It's free to send in ticks for identification. For USD 15	 Maine residents could have deer ticks tested for causative agents of Lyme disease	 anaplasmosis	 and babesiosis -- the 3 most common tick-borne diseases in Maine.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A total of 2697 ticks were submitted to the lab in 2019. The samples came from 358 towns	 including ones from each of the state's 16 counties.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The majority of the submissions -- 2056 specimens -- were identified as deer ticks	 and these were tested for disease. According to the report	 759 (38.8%) of the deer ticks tested positive for Lyme disease. About 8% tested positive for _Anaplasma_. And about 6% tested positive for _Babesia_.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
American dog ticks also made up a significant portion of the submissions	 with 585 specimens. In addition	 37 woodchuck ticks	 10 lone star ticks	 one squirrel tick and one mouse tick were sent to the lab in 2019.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
These species were not tested for diseases in 2019. But in 2020	 the lab plans to expand the program and start testing American dog ticks and lone star ticks for the causative agents of Rocky Mountain spotted fever	 ehrlichiosis and tularemia. The lab also plans to start testing deer ticks for _Borrelia miyamotoi_	 which is similar to Lyme disease and has been diagnosed in Maine residents.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The woodchuck tick is a little bit of an issue in that it's known to transmit Powassan virus,"""" Dill said. """"Unfortunately we aren't going to be testing for Powassan virus this coming year. It's an entirely different type of testing that needs to be done for that."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Collecting information from the public in this way is called """"passive surveillance"""" and can potentially result in a bias toward certain geographic locations.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We're relying on people to actually find the ticks and send them in. We're not actually going out and systematically searching the entire state,"""" Dill said. """"That can lead to some biases in the information itself. For example, you'll notice there is some clustering around Bangor and the Orono area. That's where our lab is located, so it's easier to bring in a tick around there."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Nevertheless	 Dill said that the maps generated for the report give a fairly good representation of where ticks and tick-borne diseases are found in Maine.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The report also includes information gathered from the survey that people fill out before sending in a tick for testing. This survey includes questions about where the ticks are found (often on a human body) and under what circumstances.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We wanted to know a little bit about how ticks are behaving on the body,"""" Dill said. """"That generated some interesting information about the difference of how ticks attach on adults versus children, which we somewhat expected."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The data show that ticks were more frequently found higher on the bodies of children than adults. Dill believes this is because children are shorter	 so ticks have less of a distance to travel to reach areas like the neck and head.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"In addition, the report includes what activities people were engaged in when they encountered ticks. """"Gardening-yard work"""" was the most common activity by far, accounting for about 38% of the ticks sent to the lab. """"Walking"""" came in second, accounting for about 20% of the ticks.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Furthermore	 the report showed when people encountered ticks in Maine in 2019. The data showed that Maine residents found the most adult deer ticks in late October and early November	 with a smaller peak in April and May. Nymph deer ticks	 which are smaller and younger than adult deer ticks	 peaked in June and early July. And the number of American dog ticks found peaked in early summer	 then dropped off.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The full report can be found at <https://extension.umaine.edu/ticks/>	 where you can also learn how to submit a tick for testing.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The USD 15 test for tick-borne pathogens will continue to be available to the public for 2020. In addition	 the public can send ticks to the lab for free identification	 a service that the lab has offered for several years. The lab also plans to increase field monitoring for disease-carrying ticks throughout Maine.;;;;;;;;;;

"[When a larva of the tick _Ixodes scapularis_ feeds on an infected rodent, after molting to nymph it can transmit the _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (the causative agent of Lyme disease) to the next host it feeds on. Adult ticks can also transmit the pathogen if they fed on infected rodents at an earlier stage. A prevalence near 40% is high, and it means that there are many infected white-footed mice (_Peromyscus leucopus_) on which ticks fed in their prior life stage. White-footed mice are the reservoir of _B. burgdorferi_. If ticks feed predominantly on that host, infection rates in ticks are to rise. When the rodent community is richer (i.e., it is composed by more rodent species), ticks are less likely to feed on infected white-footed mice and the prevalence may decrease. This is known as the """"dilution"""" effect. It would be interesting to link these surveillance efforts to studies on the community of mammals that are hosts to _I. scapularis_. - Mod.PMB;;;;;;;;;;"

Each 5th tick	 which has been investigated in the laboratory of the Latvian Infectology Centre	 contains _Borrelia_ or the initiator of Lyme disease	 Latvian Television reported [14 Jul 2021]. Only 2% of the ticks tested were infected with tick encephalitis [virus]. It doesn't mean that everyone who gets these ticks inevitably gets sick. But medics remind the public to be careful outdoors and take suitable precautions when in areas potentially containing ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
727 ticks have been removed by [11 Jul 2021] at Riga East Clinical University Hospital (RAKUS). Not all removed ticks are analyzed as it is a paid-for service. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Tick encephalitis is an acute central nervous system disease. The most serious cases end up with death or disability	 and may also include headache	 fatigue	 trouble balancing or other consequences.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Of the tick tested	 3 or 1.7% were positive for encephalitis [virus] in the laboratory from a total of 176 ticks. That number varies every year. In 2015	 5% were infected	 4% in 2016	 and in 2018 and 2019 only 0.65% and 0.82% of all ticks tested [were positive for the virus].;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Baiba Rozentale, chief doctor of the Infectology Center, explained: """"[Infection] with tick-borne encephalitis virus is increasing. Let's see what the dynamics will be. We can only say that we have 6 patients at the moment;"" 4 have been cured. At present"	 more people are near the sea and sand	" there is less access to [ticks]. See what autumn will be."""""""""";;;;;;;;;"																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Meanwhile	 Lyme disease agents are found more frequently in ticks this year. There were 213 ticks investigated for _Borrelia_	 with 40 or 18.8% infected.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"A vaccine is available against tick-borne encephalitis [virus] and can therefore protect people. """"That can't be said about Lyme borreliosis, where there is no vaccine. It is therefore important to find out whether the tick was infected and whether the borreliosis went over to the person,"""" noted Sergejs Nikisins, head of the Reference Laboratory of the Center.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Even if the tick is infected	 much depends on how long the insect is attached	 because it is not always and not immediately that the pathogen from the tick comes into human blood.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Rozentale said: """"But people should be calm, because we have only one patient in the hospital with an early form [of Lyme disease?] that needs to be treated. Local treatment is outpatient. But most don't get sick. Because the skin and subcutaneous cells catch the agent and the person does not get sick."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Doctors nevertheless remind that you should be careful and check your and your children's bodies after going out in nature.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Long trousers tucked into socks while passing through long grass or undergrowth	 tick repellent sprays and regular checks to see if any ticks are crawling towards the fleshier parts of the body that they prefer are all sensible precautions.;;;;;;;;;;

"[Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) has been diagnosed in Latvia before. Dr. Berger earlier commented that, """"... a marked peak in incidence of cases per 100 000 population [occurred] between 1994-1999, with lower, but constant, incidence rates thereafter."""" He added that changes in rates of TBE incidence in both Latvia and Estonia could be due to a variety of factors (see ProMED-mail post Tick-borne encephalitis virus - Latvia (02): comment 20170523.5057586). ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Cases of the European TBE subtype occur in Central and Western Europe. Finding tick-borne encephalitis virus in the ticks reported above is a warning that the transmission season is underway. Tick-borne encephalitis is a viral infection caused by one of 3 tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the _Flaviviridae_ family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). The Central European subtype is found in Latvia. It is transmitted to humans there through the bite of infected sheep ticks, _Ixodes ricinus_. The WHO states, """"Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany respectively, and based on European strains of the virus;"" and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir"	" manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far- Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious."""""""" "";;;;;;;;;"

Although this is the 1st Lyme disease report in Latvia that ProMED-mail has posted	 there have been previous reports in the Baltic area. In 2007	 Dr. Steve Berger stated that Lyme disease is extremely common in the Baltic region. In fact	 disease rates are severalfold higher in this area than in the USA (see graph at <http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Lyme-Baltic.jpg> (see Lyme disease - Estonia (Saaremaa) (02): background 20070625.2048). - Mod.TY;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
Cases of Lyme disease in the UK may be 3 times higher than previous estimates	 according to new research [1]. After analysing the anonymous medical records of 8.4 million people from across the UK	 scientists forecast that the total number of Lyme disease diagnoses in the UK could top 8000 in 2019	 compared with previous estimates of between 2000 and 3000 annual diagnoses.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is a bacterial infection	 which is passed on through being bitten by an infected tick. The small spider-like creatures feed off the blood of animals and are typically found in dense	 moist vegetation.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The research	 published in the journal BMJ Open	 found that 1/2 of cases occurred between June and August. Although there were diagnoses across all regions of the UK during the period studied	 Scotland had the highest number of cases	 at 27% of the total. The authors suggest this could be due to the region's wetter climate and popularity with hikers. The south-west and south of England also recorded a higher than average number of cases.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The data showed that the number of diagnoses increased almost 10-fold over the period studied. This	 the researchers said	 was partly down to increased caution by GPs and greater public awareness.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The exact number isn't so important,"""" said Dr Victoria Cairns, the lead author of the study. """"The point is that it's a lot, and it's everywhere, and that's why people should be informed."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Dr Anne Cruikshank, the Royal College of GPs' clinical champion for Lyme disease, said: """"These levels are not a big surprise to those of us who know about Lyme disease. I expect the 8000 figure may be an underestimate, since the data shows that positive lab results have doubled every 5 years."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Cairns said she hoped the new data would encourage the public to take more preventive measures, and bring about faster diagnoses. """"The main thing that should come out of [this work] is to be on the alert. There's no need to panic, the treatment works -- but if you don't get it in time you might have some long-term problems."""";;;;;;;;;;"

Abstract;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
--------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to estimate the annual incidence of Lyme disease (LD) in the UK.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Design: This was a retrospective descriptive cohort study.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Setting: Study data were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)	 a primary care database covering about 8% of the population in the UK in 658 primary care practices.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Participants: Cohort of 8.4 million individuals registered with general practitioners with 52.4 million person-years of observation between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2012.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Primary and secondary outcome measures: LD was identified from recorded medical codes	 notes indicating LD	 laboratory tests and use of specific antibiotics. Annual incidence rates and the estimated total number of LD cases were calculated separately for each UK region.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Results: The number of cases of LD increased rapidly over the years 2001 to 2012	 leading to an estimated incidence rate of 12.1 (95% CI 11.1 to 13.2) per 100 000 individuals per year and a UK total of 7738 LD cases in 2012. LD was detected in every UK region with highest incidence rates and largest number of cases in Scotland followed by South West and South England. If the number of cases has continued to rise since the end of the study period	 then the number in the UK in 2019 could be over 8000.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Conclusions: The incidence of LD is about 3-fold higher than previously estimated, and people are at risk throughout the UK. These results should lead to increased awareness of the need for preventive measures."""";;;;;;;;;;"

;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere	 occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America	 Europe	 and Asia. It is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete	 _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato group. Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks	 and various small and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The species of tick	 the host species	 borrelial genospecies	 and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the main pathogenic species identified in North America. It also occurs in Europe but is less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_	 the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies; All are present in the United Kingdom (UK)	 and _B. garinii_ appears to be the most prevalent pathogenic genospecies in most endemic areas of this country (<https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140714115146/http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1309968694565>).;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Different clinical manifestations are often associated with these different genospecies. Erythema migrans (EM) and Lyme arthritis are more common in the United States than in Europe. In the US	 as many as 80-90 percent of patients with Lyme disease develop the characteristic EM rash (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs_symptoms/index.html>); whereas neuroborreliosis [that is	 Lyme affecting the nervous system]	 borrelial lymphocytoma [that is	 bluish-red nodular swelling]	 and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans occur more frequently in Europe. Genetic differences between species within the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex may also result in problems with the serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis	;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In Europe	 _B. burgdorferi_ genospecies that cause Lyme borreliosis are mainly transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. In a literature review of studies of the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato in _I. ricinus_ ticks in various European countries	 the overall mean prevalence of _B. burgdorferi _ in ticks was 13.7%; for the UK the prevalence ranged from 3.9 to 8.5 (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/>).;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Increases in incidence of Lyme disease are likely the result of several factors that include: 1) greater recognition	 2) improved reporting	 as well as 3) a true increase in disease incidence due to a) more people living in suburban neighborhoods near wooded areas with b) enlarging populations of deer	 which	 although not susceptible to Lyme disease	 supply the adult tick with a required blood meal	 c) enlarging populations of both the white-footed mouse and other small rodents (the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease) and spirochete-infected nymphal _Ixodes_ species	 and d) changing climatic conditions that favor proliferation of the tick	 mouse and deer populations.;;;;;;;;;;																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is endemic in many parts of the UK	 particularly in woodland and heath-land areas	 and occasional cases are acquired in peri-urban parks and recreational areas with suitable habitat. Laboratory-confirmed reports of Lyme borreliosis have risen steadily in the UK since reporting began in 1986; the mean annual incidence rates for laboratory-confirmed cases was 1.73 cases per 100 000 total population in 2015	 when about 15-18% were reported to have been acquired abroad (<http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Lyme-Disease.htm#ref3>).;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
However	 the study reported by the news article above says that the annual incidence of Lyme disease in the UK may actually be three times higher than current estimates (2000 to 3000 cases). As in the UK	 Lyme disease is underreported in the U.S. Lyme disease became nationally notifiable in the U.S. in 1991 and the annual number of confirmed cases reported to the CDC since then has steadily risen. In 2013 the CDC reported that although more than 30 000 cases were reported annually	 the C.D.C. estimated about 300 000 Americans get Lyme disease each year	 10 times higher than the yearly reported number (<https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0819-lyme-disease.html> and ProMED-mail post Lyme disease - USA (04): underreporting 20130822.1894924). - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;;;

The CDC says there is an accelerating trend of tickborne diseases in the U.S. as we begin National Lyme Disease Awareness Month.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Scott Moore is a Veterinarian at the Fairmont Veterinary Hospital. He's one of the hundreds of vets in West Virginia and the Northeast that are treating more and more dogs for Lyme disease every year.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"In the last 15 years, we've seen a dramatic rise in Lyme disease cases,"""" Moore said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
According to data from the nonprofit Pets and Parasites	 about 1 out of every 20 dogs tested for the disease in West Virginia were positive in 2014. Last year [2018]	 it was 1 of 10.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Medical professionals aren't quite sure what is causing the increase	 which is progressively worse further up the East Coast. But Moore is seeing some trends.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We're seeing a lot more ticks carrying Lyme disease in our area as opposed to the common wood tick,"""" Moore said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The CDC also warns that the U.S. isn't fully prepared to control the threat of increasing tick populations.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Local and state health departments and vector control organizations face increasing demands to respond to ticks and tickborne diseases,"""" a 2018 CDC report said. """"Proven and publicly accepted methods are needed to better prevent tick bites and to control ticks and tickborne diseases."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease isn't contagious. But it can be deadly if not treated early.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Sometimes the dogs won't be able to move well. In some cases, it can progress to kidney failure,"""" Moore said. """"When Lyme disease hits the kidney, it's almost 100 percent fatal."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
He recommends getting good flea and tick prevention for dogs or investing in a flea and tick collar.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The CDC suggests checking yourself for ticks and showering within 2 hours of coming inside including from your own backyard.;;;;;;;;;;

[Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne illness in the United States. In 2017	 the latest year for which the CDC has published the number of confirmed cases and the incidence of Lyme disease nationally and by state (<https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/index.html>)	 a total of 42 743 confirmed and probable cases of Lyme disease were reported to CDC	 over 17 percent more than in 2016. The geographic distribution of high incidence areas with Lyme disease appears to be expanding based on data reported to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) <https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html>. The number of counties with an incidence of 10 or more confirmed cases per 100 000 persons increased from 324 in 2008 to 454 in 2017.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
According to the CDC	 the highest incidences were in the following regions: New England	 Middle Atlantic	 and East North Central. The highest 12 states of confirmed and reported cases for 2017 are: Connecticut	 1381; Maine	 1424; New Jersey 3629; New York	 excluding New York City	 2906; Pennsylvania	 9250; New Hampshire: 956; Rhode Island	 595; Wisconsin 1794; Minnesota	 1408; Maryland 1194; Virginia 1041	 West Virginia 503. Massachusetts is no longer reporting to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System so figures for 2017 must be obtained from the state office.														
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
It should be noted that although Lyme disease is occasionally reported from other states	 because cases are reported by county of residence at the time of diagnosis	 the infection was not necessarily acquired in those states or counties	 which can be different from the state or county where the patient was infected.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The incidence rates of Lyme disease in West Virginia have been gradually rising since 2006	 but in 2015 the incidence rate more than doubled	 from 6.1 in 2014 to 13.2 in 2015 and rose again to 16.2 in 2016 (when there were 297 confirmed and 71 probable cases). Most cases were reported from counties located in the northern part of the state	 especially counties that border Pennsylvania or Maryland (<https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/index.html>).;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
While the above statistics represent the disease in human beings	 it is a gauge of the disease in our pets as well. There are a number of products available to prevent ticks from being on your pet for very long. The recommended product for your pet's health condition is best determined with your veterinarian. There is also an available vaccine for dogs. This and all vaccines should be discussed with your veterinarian.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
All personnel who work around animals or outside	 even in yards	 should regularly check themselves for ticks. Small seed ticks can easily crawl up a pant leg and attach somewhere along the route up to the waist band. Seed ticks can be very tiny and may initially look like a small freckle. However	 checking for ticks is extremely important. Disease may be transmitted to you in as little as 1-2 hours after the tick attaches.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Your pet's health is vital to your own health	 as pets can bring these pests inside to you or they can crawl off of the pet and onto human beings	 thus transmitting disease to your pet and to you.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There are a number of different ticks carrying a variety of diseases. Lyme seems to be more prevalent in the Northeast and Eastern seaboard of the United States	 but does appear all across the USA. A number of other diseases including ehrlichiosis	 and Rocky Mountain spotted fever are among the other diseases capable of affecting you and your pets. Please get appropriate protection for your pets	 which includes cats. - Mod.TG;;;;;;;;;;

Reported cases of a tick-borne disease are swelling in Maine this year [2017]	 but it's not Lyme disease. Cases of anaplasmosis	 an illness with flu-like symptoms that are similar to Lyme but typically more severe	 have jumped from 52 a year in Maine 5 years ago to 433 this year	 through [24 Oct 2017]	 according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Of this year's 433 cases	 113 were hospitalized	 according to Maine CDC statistics.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The deer tick	 the same tick that's a carrier for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease	 is also a carrier for anaplasmosis.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme -- of which there have been more than 1000 cases per year in Maine since 2011 -- has established a long-term presence in the state	 but anaplasmosis has remained under the radar.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Anaplasmosis cases are also rising in other New England states: Massachusetts had 828 cases in 2016 compared to about 200 in 2012	 while New Hampshire	 Vermont	 and Rhode Island are also reporting increases. Lyme cases remain strong in Maine	 but the 1039 cases through September [2017] are below 5-year averages. Another tick-borne disease	 babesiosis	 is also increasing	 but still at much lower rates than Lyme or anaplasmosis	 with 93 cases through September [2017].;;;;;;;;;;																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Anaplasmosis symptoms are flu-like and can include fever	 chills	 fatigue	 and joint pain. About 25-30 percent of all anaplasmosis cases result in hospitalizations	 compared to about 5 percent of Lyme cases.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Mainers are more at risk of anaplasmosis, experts say, for a number of reasons. Part of the issue is greater awareness and more testing by people who fall ill. But also, more deer ticks are infected with anaplasmosis and passing the bacteria on to humans, said Chuck Lubelczyk, a field biologist with the Maine Medical Center Research Institute in Scarborough. """"It certainly is spreading,"""" Lubelczyk said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Several years ago	 in southern Maine	 5 percent or fewer of ticks that were tested had anaplasmosis	 he said. Now	 it's doubled	 and about 10 percent of the ticks are infected with anaplasmosis. In the midcoast and points north	 it was extremely rare for a deer tick to have anaplasmosis bacteria. A few percent of the tested ticks along the midcoast now have it	 about the same rates as southern Maine 5 to 7 years ago	 Lubelczyk said.;;;;;;;;;;																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In comparison	 more than 50 percent of deer ticks -- sometimes more than 65 percent -- carry Lyme disease in Maine.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lubelczyk said ticks seem to be out earlier and longer than previously, emerging earlier in the spring and lingering into the fall, and he sees more nymph-stage ticks, which are small and difficult to detect. """"We may be having 2 different tick populations, one that arrives earlier and another that arrives later. It's not clear yet,"""" he said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Sara Robinson, a Maine CDC epidemiologist, said anaplasmosis is more difficult to detect than Lyme, as anaplasmosis does not have the """"bull's-eye"""" rash that appears in some infected with Lyme, signaling that they have the disease. Robinson said the best way to tell is if you're feeling like you have the flu outside of flu season, which is typically October to May. """"If you feel like you're getting the flu in the summer, call your doctor,"""" Robinson said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Anaplasmosis is becoming more frequent in Maine and particularly emergency room and urgent care sites need to be aware that a 'summer flu' in an endemic area is anaplasmosis until proven otherwise,"""" [Dr Heidi Heap-Chester, who cared for a patient who tested positive for """"multiple tick-borne diseases""""] said. Anaplasmosis responds well to antibiotic treatment if caught early, but it's difficult to catch early.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Prevention is also key. Wear long clothing and repellents when in tick habitat	 such as the woods	 and when picking up dead wood or leaves. Check often for ticks	 which are difficult to see. Lubelczyk said one of the more common ways to pick up a tick is from your pet. The tick that's on your pet can drop off after feeding and crawl on you.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
People who do find a tick on them should remove it immediately and have it tested. In most cases	 ticks need to be attached to a human for 36 hours before diseases can be transmitted.;;;;;;;;;;

[_Anaplasma phagocytophilum_	 the causative agent of anaplasmosis (also known as human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA)	 _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 the causative agent of Lyme disease	 and _Babesia microti_	 the causative agent of babesiosis	 are transmitted to humans in wooded areas of the northeastern United States by the same tick (_Ixodes scapularis_). Typically	 the nymph stage of the tick	 which is about the size of a poppy seed	 transmits these diseases. For a picture of the nymph	 see <http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/>. Patients may be concurrently co-infected by these pathogens.;;;;;;;;;;															
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
An increased incidence of anaplasmosis can be due to a true increase in the number of cases as the primary vector and the reservoir hosts spread geographically into previously uninvolved regions	 but also better recognition and reporting of these diseases may contribute to the increases in the number of reported cases.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Some individuals infected with _A. phagocytophilum_ do not become ill or experience only very mild symptoms and do not seek medical treatment. The symptoms tend to be most severe in aged or immunosuppressed people. In infected persons who are symptomatic with anaplasmosis	 illness onset occurs 5-21 days after a bite from an infected tick. Initial presentation typically includes sudden onset of fever	 headache	 malaise	 and myalgia	 often accompanied by thrombocytopenia	 leukopenia	 and elevated liver transaminases. Approximately 5 to 7 percent of patients require intensive care	 and the disease can be fatal. Severe infections can include prolonged fever	 shock	 confusion	 seizures	 pneumonitis	 renal failure	 hemorrhages	 and death.;;;;;;;;;;										
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The presence of hemolytic anemia suggests babesiosis. Some patients also have splenomegaly	 hepatomegaly	 or jaundice. Severe cases can be associated with marked thrombocytopenia	 disseminated intravascular coagulation	 hemodynamic instability	 acute respiratory distress	 myocardial infarction	 renal failure	 hepatic compromise	 altered mental status	 and death.;;;;;;;;;;															
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Their diagnoses are based on specific antibody tests	 detection of specific nucleic acid (DNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)	 and microscopy of thick and thin blood films. In babesiosis	 manual (non-automated) review of Wright-stained peripheral blood smears or buffy-coat preparations can demonstrate intraerythrocytic ring forms. Sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between _Babesia_ and _Plasmodium_ (especially _P. falciparum_) parasites. Cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of vacuolar microcolonies of _A. phagocytophilum_ within neutrophils can be found in 20 to 80 percent of patients with anaplasmosis	 unlike the rarity of visualizing organisms within circulating mononuclear cells in patients with human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (Weinberg G: Laboratory diagnosis of ehrlichiosis and babesiosis. Pediat Infect Dis J 2001; 20(4): 435-7).;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Because _A. phagocytophilum_ and _B. microti_ are found in the blood stream	 infected blood can serve as a vehicle for person-to-person transmission (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ transmitted through blood transfusion -- Minnesota	 2007. MMWR 2008; 57(42): 1145-8. [date cited] Available from <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5742a1.htm>).;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally or intravenously for 10 days for all symptomatic patients suspected of having anaplasmosis is recommended for a minimal total course of 10 days. This treatment regimen should be adequate therapy for patients with anaplasmosis alone and for patients who are co-infected with Lyme disease	 but is not effective therapy for patients who are co-infected with _B. microti_.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Most asymptomatic persons with babesiosis do not require treatment. For ill patients	 babesiosis is treated for at least 7-10 days with a combination of either: atovaquone plus azithromycin	 or clindamycin plus quinine (this combination is the standard of care for severely ill patients).;;;;;;;;;;

The Ohio Department of Health is reporting Lyme disease cases in the state this year are up 33 percent from 2016. The department says 241 cases of Lyme disease have been reported in 60 Ohio counties so far in 2017. There were only 160 cases in 2016.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The increase in cases coincides with the increase of the blacklegged tick in Ohio.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is a bacterial disease transmitted to humans via the bite of an infected deer tick. Symptoms can include a flu-like illness	 muscle pain	 and headache; a bull's-eye shaped rash is often also seen at the site of the bite as well.;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Ohio Department of Health Medical Director Dr. Clint Koenig says: """"Lyme disease is still very important to think about, even in cold weather. You still need to take precautions, like wearing bug repellent, to make sure you are protected while outside enjoying the fall season."""" Fall hunting season has begun and deer gun season begins on [Mon 27 Nov 2017].;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Here are some tips on how to avoid tick bites before and after you hunt:;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 - When possible	 walk in the center of trails and paths to avoid brushing up;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
against ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 - Apply bug repellent to everyone in your party	 including pets.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 - Tuck your pants into your boots or socks and tuck your shirt into your;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
pants to prevent ticks from crawling inside clothing.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 - Shower immediately after returning from the outdoors to remove unattached	 ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 - Check dogs for ticks after returning from tick habitats.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 - Remove any attached tick immediately by grasping it with tweezers	 as close to the skin as possible	 and pulling it straight out. Do not twist or jerk.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There are currently no vaccines to prevent tickborne diseases. If detected at an early stage	 Lyme disease can be treated successfully with appropriate antibiotic therapy.;;;;;;;;;;

[Deer play no role in infecting black-legged ticks	 the vector for Lyme disease	 with the bacterium that causes Lyme disease	 _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 because deer are not carriers of this bacterium. Tick larvae and nymphs typically become infected with Lyme disease bacteria when feeding on infected small mammals such as white-footed mice	 the principal reservoir for _B. burgdorferi_. Adult female ticks may feed on medium- to large-sized animal hosts for a blood meal that is required for egg production	 but deer are their principal hosts. Deer also supply the tick with a place to mate. Deer may have at least 10 to 50 female ticks attaching and dropping off each day during the season when adult ticks are active. Each female tick then lays around 2000 eggs and dies. Eggs will produce larvae free of borrelia.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The infected female ticks that drop from deer present little danger to humans or other animals since the ticks are now at the end of their life cycle and will not feed again. The nymph more often transmits infection to people; because of their small size	 we do not notice the nymphs or their bite.;;;;;;;;;

Deer reduction has been examined as a method to manage tick abundance and tick-borne diseases (<http://www.ct.gov/caes/lib/caes/documents/publications/fact_sheets/entomology/deer_&_ticks_fact_sheet.pdf>). However	 reducing the deer population has not always resulted in a significant fall in the tick population or fall in the incidence of Lyme disease in humans (<https://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/are-deer-the-culprit-in-lyme-disease/>).;;;;;;;;;;

The risk of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ infection for dogs exceeds the risk for people in a given geographic area. More than half the dogs may be antibody positive in some high-risk areas	 while the antibody positive rate for human residents in the same area is around 10 percent {Berrada	 2009 #277}. But exposed dogs are much less likely to become sick than humans after infection {Littman	 2006 #246}. What disease occurs in dogs is mainly in puppies and in the form of arthritis leading to lameness several weeks after an infecting tick bite. There are reports of an uncommon but serious kidney disorder that is suspected to be caused by a combination of _B. burgdorferi_ infection itself and the immune response to it. The most commonly used diagnostic test for antibodies in dogs is an EIA [enzyme immunoassay] test with C6 peptide	 which is similar to the human assay. A follow-up Western Blot is seldom performed	 so there may be more false-positive test results for dogs.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
For seropositive dogs with joint disease or the kidney disease	 antibiotics are commonly prescribed. If _B. burgdorferi_ infection was the cause	 the lameness tends to respond more quickly to the antibiotics than does the longer-standing kidney disorder. Although there have been studies of antibiotics in experimental infections of dogs	 there still have not been any controlled clinical trials for naturally acquired infections in the community. Doxycycline once a day by mouth is the most common therapy. Unlike amoxicillin or ceftriaxone	 this tetracycline antibiotic is also a suitable treatment of _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (Chapter 11)	 another pathogen carried by deer ticks. Alternative oral antibiotics are the macrolide azithromycin or the penicillin amoxicillin. If an intravenous antibiotic is required	 ceftriaxone is the primary option.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Should healthy dogs be screened for the _B. burgdorferi_ antibodies? There is controversy about this	 with most of the arguments against this practice {Littman	 2006 #246}. A prospective study of at-risk	 outdoor Bernese Mountain dogs in Switzerland looked at seropositive animals that showed no signs of illness at the time of the blood draw {Gerber	 2009 #253}. When they were examined 2 to 3 years later	 they were still free of lameness or kidney disease. So	 as for humans	 the seropositive state in the absence of illness or organ dysfunction is not	 by itself	 an indication for treatment.;;;;;;;;;;																
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Cats may be at as great a risk of _B. burgdorferi_ infection as dogs in areas with Lyme disease {Berrada, 2009 #277}. But, in comparison to dogs, there is much less information on either experimental or natural infections in cats. If Lyme disease is suspected in a cat, the usual antibiotic for treatment is doxycycline."""";;;;;;;;;;"

Abstract;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
--------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The purpose of this report is to offer a consensus opinion of ACVIM [American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine] diplomates on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ infections in dogs (canine Lyme disease). Clinical syndromes known to commonly be associated with canine Lyme disease include polyarthritis and glomerulopathy. Serological test results can be used to document exposure to _B. burgdorferi_ but not prove illness. Although serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay/indirect fluorescent antibody assay titers can stay positive for months to years after treatment, quantitative C6 peptide antibody paired tests need more study. Serological screening of healthy dogs is controversial because it can lead to overdiagnosis or overtreatment of normal dogs, most of which never develop Lyme disease. However, serological screening can provide seroprevalence and sentinel data and stimulate owner education about tick infections and control. Although it is unknown whether treatment of seropositive healthy dogs is beneficial, the consensus is that seropositive dogs should be evaluated for proteinuria and other coinfections and tick control prescribed. Tick control can include a product that repels or protects against tick attachment, thereby helping to prevent transmission of coinfections as well as Borrelia spp. Seropositive dogs with clinical abnormalities thought to arise from Lyme disease generally are treated with doxycycline (10 mg/kg q24h for 1 month). Proteinuric dogs might need longer treatment as well as medications and diets for protein-losing nephropathy. The ACVIM diplomates believe the use of Lyme vaccines still is controversial and most do not administer them. It is the consensus opinion that additional research is needed to study predictors of illness, """"Lyme nephropathy,"""" and coinfections in Lyme endemic areas.;;;;;;;;;;"

Anyone with 4-legged loved ones may want to be sure their flea and tick medications are up to date	 because area veterinarians say cases are increasing.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dr Scott Moore	 a veterinarian at Fairmont Veterinary Hospital	 said his clinic sees 1 to 2 cases per week	 not only through the summer but year round.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Over the last 3 years, it has gone up dramatically in this area,"""" Moore said. """"In the state of West Virginia last year [2016], it was about 1 in 16 dogs tested positive for Lyme disease. That's a pretty high number. As far as for us, I think last year [2016] we had 90 to 95 cases in our office."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Veterinarians predict the rise can be attributed	 at least partially	 to a milder winter	 as it must be below 40 deg F [4.5 deg C] for Lyme disease to become inactive.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"It was a pretty mild winter, so we had ticks in January and February, and they increase now in the spring, but they're always out there,"""" said Dr Gary McCutcheon, a veterinarian at All Pets Animal Clinic.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"They don't go away like a lot of bugs do,"""" McCutcheon said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"He said Lyme disease isn't the only disease that ticks can transmit. """"Lyme disease gets all the press, but there are also things like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and those types of things,"""" he said. """"There are certain regions of the country where they're more prevalent than others. Lyme disease is spreading because as people move, they might take ticks with them. It used to be just in the Southeast, but now it's pretty much across most of the country."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Moore said there has been a trend over the past 10 years that ticks carrying Lyme disease have been becoming more prevalent in northern states.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"So we actually expected this to happen,"""" he said. """"Up in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area, the rate of Lyme disease is a lot higher, as far as dogs tested. We're still on the edge of it."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Moore said his facility has also had cats test positive recently	 although it's still unknown if the disease is a significant issue for cats.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"In dogs, it causes severe lameness, and it can be to the point that those animals can't move,"""" he said. """"Their joints get infected and inflamed, and those animals have a lot of pain."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In a worst-case scenario	 Moore said Lyme disease can lead to a non-treatable form of kidney failure in canines.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"I have spoken with one veterinarian in the last 5 years who has been able to successfully get a kidney failure patient out of that situation,"""" he said. """"They caught that patient at an extraordinarily early stage. Once they become symptomatic for kidney disease from Lyme disease, for most of those patients, it's fatal."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Most canine patients	 however	 do not progress to that point.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The really exciting thing is the majority of cases that we diagnose are diagnosed on a screening test, so they're asymptomatic,"""" Moore said. """"The asymptomatic patients have actually been very effectively treated with antibiotics. It's a month's course of antibiotics, and when we follow up their testing, we can show that they demonstrate significant improvement."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Diseases associated with tick bites can sometimes be hard to diagnose	 McCutcheon said.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Just like a human, they (dogs) can get bitten by a tick and not even know it,"""" he said. """"They have signs, but it's not a real common thing you think of. I think they're becoming more prevalent, and they're testing for it more. When you test more, you're going to find more."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Of course	 Lyme disease is completely preventable	 thanks to many preventive methods available at veterinary clinics.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"There are basically 2 really good ways to prevent it, and I think everybody should do both,"""" Moore said. """"One is with a very good flea and tick product. If you're not sure if what you're using covers ticks, you should check with your veterinarian."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Medications provide one-month and 3-month coverage for pets.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"In dogs and cats both, Frontline has been around a long time, and many people use it,"""" McCutcheon said. """"We also like the Seresto collar, which is an 8-month collar, with one for dogs and one for cats. It sort of acts as a repellent, too, and does a great job. They stay effective even if they get wet."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Moore said vaccines are also available.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"There's still not a vaccine for humans, but there is a very good vaccine for dogs,"""" he said. """"I would recommend an annual vaccination for Lyme disease and monthly or full-coverage."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease	 even in humans	 is a relatively new disease -- it was first discovered about 30 years ago -- and until recently it was thought that once a patient developed the disease	 it would carry it forever.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Now, they think if you catch it early, there is a possibility of complete treatment success,"""" Moore said. """"That's an improvement over where we thought we were."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Treatments have improved greatly in that time as well, McCutcheon said. """"It used to be we had to use sprays and powders and react to a problem,"""" he said. """"Now, we have wonderful products to prevent. It's a change of mindset where we can prevent things, and, if you can prevent things, that's great."""";;;;;;;;;;"

[Lyme borreliosis is a bacterial	 tick-transmitted disease of animals (dogs	 horses	 probably cats) and people. In people one of the common lesions is a target shaped red lesion	 sometimes called a 'bull's eye' lesion in reference to hitting the center of a target.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The history of Lyme disease in Connecticut began in 1975 when a cluster of children and adults residing in the Lyme	 Connecticut area experienced uncommon arthritic symptoms (1976 circular letter; <http://tinyurl.com/mt4j3ku>). By 1977	 the 1st 51 cases of Lyme arthritis were described	 and the _Ixodes scapularis_ (black-legged) tick was linked to the transmission of the disease. During 1982	 _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 the bacterium that causes Lyme disease	 was discovered and the 1st brochure addressing Lyme disease was developed by the Arthritis Foundation. Serology testing became widely available in Connecticut during 1984. In 1987	 Lyme disease became a reportable disease. All physicians were required to report any and all cases of the disease. By 1988	 the news of Lyme disease spread and national media attention began. The first federal funding for Lyme disease surveillance	 education	 and research became available in 1991. The first Lyme disease vaccine became available in 1997. To help determine the efficacy of the vaccine	 Lyme disease was made laboratory reportable in 1998. However	 the manufacturer withdrew the vaccine from the market in 2001. In 2002	 the vaccine efficacy study ended	" and Lyme disease was removed from the list of laboratory reportable findings;"" however"	" it remained a physician reportable disease.""""""""

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In the US	 the incidence of Lyme disease is highly concentrated in northeastern	 mid-Atlantic	 and north-central states	 where the incidence rates varied from 14.4 to 70.5/100 000 in 2014	 in contrast to the southeastern states	 where the incidence rates were less than 1/100 000 in 2014 (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/tables.html>). A map of the US showing the distribution of Lyme disease cases can be found at (<https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/maps.html>). This article states our mobile society has been responsible for moving the vectors around and all areas are now quite likely to see this disease at any given time.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"There are """"19 different genospecies that fall within the _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex. Within this complex, the most important spirochete species are _B burgdorferi_ sensu stricto (North America, Europe), _B. afzelii_ (Europe, Asia), _B. bavariensis_, and _B. garinii_ (Europe, Asia), all of which are pathogenic for people. Only _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto has been shown so far to be pathogenic for domestic animals under experimental conditions. Tick vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato are hard-shelled _Ixodes_ ticks. In the USA, these are primarily _I. scapularis_ in the northeast and Midwest and _I. pacificus_ on the Pacific coast. _I. ricinus_ and _I. persulcatus_ are the primary vectors in Europe and Asia. _B. miyamotoi_ is another member of the genus _Borrelia_. Although this spirochete is transmitted by ixodid ticks and may cause infections in mammals characterized by clinical signs such as fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches, the bacterium is a relapsing, fever-causing organism.""""

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
While this article mentions joint infection/inflammation	 lameness	 and renal problems	 animals may also present with cardiac abnormalities. Most often dogs are seen with lethargy and fever	 intermittent to recurrent lameness; anorexia; and sometimes lymphadenopathy with or without swollen	 painful joints as the most common clinical signs. Clinical signs are generally non specific and can be a diagnostic challenge as owners may not know their animals have had tick bites	 and may not know if they themselves have had tick bites. A variety of blood or serum tests are available to help diagnose this disease.;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Early diagnosis is the key to successful treatment and prevention of fatal consequences	 such as kidney failure or cardiac failure. Antibiotics are generally successful when the disease is caught early.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There are vaccines available for dogs	 but not for human beings. There are also a number of tick and flea repellents	 either as oral or topical applications for both the dog and the cat. Keeping ticks off of your pet can help protect you. However	 ticks can often ride into the home undetected on shoes or pants. Regardless of where you live or travel	 tick prevention for your pets a good idea. - Mod.TG;;;;;;;;;;

According to the most recent data published by the Laurentian Public Health Department	 since the beginning of 2018	 3 cases of Lyme disease infection have been reported in the region. On average since 2013	 there are about 10 cases per year.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The number of cases is increasing,"""" says Julie Lemieux-Côté, CISSS Laurentides [Centre Intégré de Santé et de Services Sociaux (CISSS) des Laurentides or Integrated Health and Social Services Center of the Laurentians]. On the other hand, she says, the prevalence rate -- the number of cases per 100 000 population --, remains lower in the Laurentians than in Quebec for the 2013-2017 period.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lyme disease is growing steadily in southern Quebec,"""" says Lemieux-Côté. According to him, the increase in the number of cases can be explained by several factors. First, she says, """"the presence of ticks in Laurentian territory seems to be increasing over the years."""" Birds that carry more and more ticks from endemic areas that are expanding would be the main culprits.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The fact that the general population and clinicians are more aware of this emerging disease also leads to more medical consultations and more prescriptions for diagnostic tests for the disease. """"The diagnostic criteria and the case definitions are becoming more precise, which makes it possible to obtain confirmed cases for our region,"""" added Ms. Lemieux-Côté.;;;;;;;;;;"

[Quebec is a province in eastern Canada. Laurentides	 with a population of 555 614 residents in 2011	 is one of 17 administrative regions in Quebec. A map of Quebec regions can be found at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_Quebec>. Laurentides includes part of the Laurentian Mountain Range	 which is a popular summer and winter tourist destination	 with lake cottages culture in the summer	 and skiing in the winter (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurentides>). The Laurentian Range extends across the U.S. border to the south	 to the Adirondack Mountains in New York State	 where Lyme disease is endemic.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Factors that could account for an increase in Lyme disease incidence in Laurentides include climate change	 growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas	 and enlarging populations of deer	 white-footed mice and other small rodents	 and _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_. Nymphal _I. scapularis_ are the primary tick vector for Lyme disease in northeastern US and southeastern Canada. Deer	 although not susceptible to Lyme disease	 supply the adult tick with a required blood meal; white-footed mice and other small rodents are the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;

Erie County's record number of Lyme disease cases in 2016 is probably due to a couple of different factors	 a local infectious disease expert said.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
At least 186 cases have been reported to the Erie County Department of Health in 2016	 well above the record 71 cases reported in 2015. As recently as 2008	 only 9 cases were reported in the county.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"I think doctors are diagnosing more cases they might have missed in the past because they are more aware of Lyme disease,"""" said Nancy Weissbach, M.D., Saint Vincent Hospital's chief of infectious diseases. """"But I also think there are more cases out there because there are more (infected) ticks."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease	 a bacterial infection	 is spread to humans primarily by deer ticks. The number of cases in the county has increased as infected ticks have migrated from Presque Isle State Park	 where they were 1st found in the 1980s	 to wooded and grassy areas throughout the county.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease cases in Erie County by year: 2012 - 14 [cases]; 2013 - 25; 2014 - 55; 2015 - 71; [and] 2016 - 179 (through 16 Dec 2016).;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Source: Erie County Department of Health: """"Even though it's been cold lately, all it takes is one warm day, and we get calls about ticks,"""" said Breanna Adams, an environmental protection specialist with the health department.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Doctors are concerned about an increase in cases because Lyme disease can cause serious health problems or death if left untreated. The good news is that Lyme disease is often cured in its initial stage with a single dose of the antibiotic doxycycline.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"It's so important to catch Lyme disease in its early stages or prevent it by avoiding tick bites,"""" Weissbach said. The best way to reduce your risk of acquiring Lyme disease is to take precautions when walking in the woods or grassy areas. You should always wear long-sleeved shirts and tuck your pants into your socks to prevent ticks from climbing onto your skin. Spray your clothing with the insect repellent permethrin, though don't spray it directly onto your skin. Use a different repellent with Deet on your skin. Once you return home, take off all your clothes and check your entire body for ticks. Pay close attention to the armpits, scalp and other dark, moist areas where ticks like to feed.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Ticks transmit Lyme disease as they feed, and it usually takes them at least 24 hours after they crawl onto a host to begin feeding. If you can easily swipe them off your skin and they aren't engorged with blood, they haven't fed. If they are firmly attached to your skin, use a pair of needle-nosed pliers to remove them. Make sure to remove the entire tick by puling upward with steady, even pressure. """"Then go to your physician's office and ask for a preventative dose of antibiotics,"""" Weissbach said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"You should also see a physician if you notice any common symptoms of Lyme disease, including fever, chills, headache, fatigue or a red rash often in the shape of a bull's-eye. Left untreated, the symptoms often disappear, but the disease often returns with more serious symptoms including joint pain, neurological problems and -- in rare cases -- heart problems, hepatitis or death. """"Lyme disease can still often be treated at a later stage with intravenous antibiotics for about a month,"""" Weissbach said. """"But it's better when it's found earlier."""";;;;;;;;;;"

Pennsylvania has reported the most Lyme disease cases for ten consecutive years and in 2016	 while not over yet	 has topped 12 000 cases	 according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data. Through Dec. 24	 the Keystone State has seen 12 092 cases (provisional)	 the most reported.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Nationally	 31 926 provisional cases have been reported to CDC. Following Pennsylvania is New York and NYC [New York City] with 4002 cases	 New Jersey (3850)	 Wisconsin (1868) and Maryland (1717).;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Each year	 more than 30 000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to CDC	 making it the most commonly reported tick-borne illness in the United States. However	 CDC estimates indicate that the number of Americans diagnosed with Lyme disease each year is around 300 000	 10 times higher than the yearly reported number.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health	 Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and is often transmitted through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick	 also known as a deer tick. Symptoms include fever	 fatigue	 headache	 muscle aches	 joint pain	 a bull's eye rash may appear	 and other symptoms that can be mistaken for viral infections	 such as influenza or infectious mononucleosis. Joint pain can be mistaken for other types of arthritis	 such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)	 and neurologic signs of Lyme disease can mimic those caused by other conditions	 such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).;;;;;;;;;;													
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
When detected early	 Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics. Left untreated	 the disease can spread to the joints	 heart and nervous system.;;;;;;;;;;

This summer's [2016] drought failed to reduce the deer tick population -- as some experts had hoped -- and Lyme disease cases have soared this fall	 turning 2016 into a possible record-setting year for the disease.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Through [5 Dec 2016]	 Lyme disease cases were 12 percent higher this year when compared to all of 2015	 according to statistics from the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"If any summer drought would have knocked the tick population back, this would have been the summer,"""" said Charles Lubelczyk, a field biologist with Maine Medical Center Research Institute's """"tick lab."""" Rainfall was far below normal this summer, and Maine experienced many hot, dry days, which can be harmful to tick populations, experts said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"But the deer ticks survived, perhaps by migrating into the deep woods and hiding under leaves. Lyme disease is transmitted to humans via the deer tick. """"Under leaf litter, the ticks were as happy as could be,"""" Lubelczyk said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Lyme disease cases seem to match the theory of a dry summer causing ticks to be inactive or retreating into the woods	 followed by a fall of the ticks returning and finding human hosts.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease was trending below 5-year averages through July	 when 469 cases had been recorded	 according to the Maine CDC. The 5-year average was 583 cases through July	 which had suggested that this year [2016] could be a mild year for Lyme disease. But instead	 Lyme cases came roaring back in the fall	 with 1336 cases counted through [5 Dec 2016].;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Usually	 there are fewer cases in the fall	 with about 70 percent of all reported cases occurring through August.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Maine saw record numbers of Lyme disease in 2014	 with 1399 cases. The number of cases in 2015 dipped to 1176 after the harsh 2014-15 winter.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease symptoms include fatigue	 dizziness	 swelling	 joint and nerve pain	 persistent headaches and flu-like symptoms.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Meanwhile	 anaplasmosis	 another tick-borne disease	 is also seeing record numbers this year [2016]	 with 358 cases so far	 compared to 186 through [5 Dec 2015].;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
James Dill	 pest management specialist at the University of Maine's Cooperative Extension	 said he believes what happened is that the deer ticks went deep into the woods where it's more moist	 to survive the dry	 hot summer. Maine had the driest summer in at least 15 years	 according to the National Weather Service	 and most of the state was undergoing moderate to severe drought conditions by the end of summer.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Ticks do not like arid conditions, which is one reason Lyme disease is not a problem in a low-humidity state like Arizona or Nevada, but has exploded along the muggy East Coast. Dill said while in the deep woods, the ticks were less likely to come into contact with humans, but instead would have attached to forest animals like rodents, rabbits and foxes. When the wet weather came back in the fall, the ticks returned to their normal habitat, which is closer to humans, like on the edges of forests, backyards or near trails. """"We had reports this fall of people's dogs coming in from backyards covered with 50 to 100 ticks,"""" Dill said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dill said another factor is that when the fall population of ticks surged	 people were more likely to notice that a tick had attached to them and get tested for Lyme disease. In most cases	 a tick needs to be attached to a host for 36 to 48 hours before Lyme disease can be transmitted	 according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
By the fall	 the ticks are adults and easier to spot	 while in the summer they are in the nymph stage and difficult to notice. Many people end up with undetected Lyme disease because they didn't notice they had a tick on them.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lubelczyk said another factor is that coastal Maine retained more humidity than the interior	 helping to keep tick populations thriving along the coast. Even in the interior	 though	 tick populations were better than expected this fall	 he said.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The tick's range continues to expand as well	 as Lubelczyk said more reports of deer ticks Down East are coming in.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The only condition that might substantially reduce the tick population is extremely cold weather -- 0 deg F [-18 deg C] or less -- that lasts 10 days in a row or longer without significant snow on the ground	 Lubelczyk said. Snow acts as an insulator	 allowing ticks to survive the winter.;;;;;;;;;;

"[Deer ticks by themselves unlikely travel far horizontally;"" travel over greater distances is achieved by the ticks' attaching themselves to migrating mammals and birds. (<https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150706143251.htm>). However"	" they can climb on vegetation to a height at which they are most likely to contact their preferred host and wait (known as """"""""questing"""""""") for a host to pass by. Decreased rainfall in the summer months in Maine could have reduced the questing nymph tick population"	 because nymph ticks require a high humidity of more than 85 percent (<http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long>)	" forcing them to move down the vegetation into more humid leaf litter on the ground to maintain hydration during summer drought conditions."";;;;;;;;;"																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The increased incidence of Lyme disease and anaplasmosis in Maine in the fall of 2016 could be due to an increase in the number of questing infected tick vectors during a wet fall season. Because nymphs quest for a blood meal at temperatures greater than 7 deg C/45 deg F (<http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long>)	 the local daytime temperatures in the fall season would have to be above this value. In fact	 daytime temperatures are mostly above 45 degrees F in Sep and Oct in Maine (<https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Maine/temperature-october.php>).;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Expositor (news outlet) recently learned of an unusually high number of Lyme disease cases in dogs on Manitoulin this summer and fall [2016].;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lyme disease is present on Manitoulin Island,"""" Doctor Janice Mitchell, a veterinarian at both the Island Animal Hospital and Scott Veterinary Services in Mindemoya, told The Expositor. """"This summer [2016], 5 cases have been confirmed at Scott Veterinary Services and one case at the Island Animal Hospital, with 5 of the 6 dogs never having left the island. The dogs were from Gore Bay, Birch Island, M'Chigeeng, South Baymouth (a Hurricane Katrina dog), Mindemoya and Evansville."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"This past summer, an 8-year-old spayed female golden retriever was presented at one of the Island veterinary clinics with a complaint of lameness,"""" Dr. Mitchell said of one case. """"She has a fever and was sore in 3 of her limbs. Bloodwork revealed a high white blood cell count and a positive antibody tied to _Borrelia burgdoferi_, otherwise known as Lyme disease."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dr. Mitchell said this is high for Manitoulin and that traditionally Lyme disease in Ontario has been seen in pocketed areas at Rondeau Provincial Park	 Point Pelee	 Long Point and the Kingston/Gananoque region.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"However, ticks are on the move, at 46 km per year to be exact, and the tick that is responsible for transmitting the Lyme is the deer tick, known as _Ixodes scapularis_,"""" added Dr. Mitchell. """"We are just seeing more and more ticks in the area;"" they are moving north. Typically"	 we find that there will be a bad tick year	 but with climate change and deer and humans colliding more	" we are seeing a rise."""""""""";;;;;;;;;"																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lyme disease (named for the Connecticut town of Lyme) is caused by a bacterial organism called _Borrelia burgdoferi_,"""" Dr. Mitchell said. """"It is transmitted to mammals through a blood sucking vector, the deer tick. The deer tick is a 3-host tick which means each growth phase (larva, nymph, adult) will molt off the host between their requisite blood meal on 3 separate mammals. A female tick will lay approximately 2000 eggs in spring, at temperatures 4 C [39 F] and above. The 6-legged larva hatches and attaches to a host as soon as it is able, usually a mouse. If the mouse is infected with the Lyme disease bacteria, the larva will be infected. It takes up to one year to molt into an 8-legged nymph. In spring, the nymph may seek another mouse or a larger host such as a human or dog. It has its blood meal and then drops off until late summer, when it molts into an adult. The adult then seeks a larger host, hence its name the """"deer tick."""" At any phase in its development, the tick can transmit the Lyme bacteria during the blood sucking phase on its host. This process of transmission can take 24-48 hours, which means that if the tick is removed in this window, the bacteria cannot be transmitted"""" [Some papers have reported transmission after 6 hours of attachment. The tick must be removed before 24 hours, and even then, there is a risk. 30 percent of patients contracting Lyme disease never recall a tick bite at all. - Mod.TG].;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Dr. Mitchell said that Lyme disease manifests itself differently in dogs compared to humans. """"After being bitten by an infected tick, 80-90 percent of humans are likely to develop the disease, whereas dogs are 5 to 10 percent likely (even less in cats),"""" she said. """"In those canines that do develop the illness, it doesn't manifest for weeks or months after infection, at which point arthritis signs are noticed. Sometimes there is a fever, and in longer standing untreated cases, kidney damage can occur. Dogs do not develop the classic bull's eye rash as is noted with humans."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Luckily, Dr. Mitchell said testing for Lyme disease in dogs is simple and quick. """"The same test for heart worm, 4DX, also tests for Lyme disease and 2 other tick diseases. It is a 10-minute blood test that detects antibodies against the organism. Once positive and if showing clinical signs, treatment consists of an inexpensive course of proper antibiotics."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Lyme disease incidents on the island will be reported to the Ontario Animal Health Network	 but the incident isn't directly reported to the Sudbury and District Health Unit (SDHU).;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Expositor contacted the SDHU to see whether there was a corresponding high number of humans diagnosed with Lyme disease this fall [2016] and whether the public should be concerned.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We haven't had any confirmed black legged ticks (deer ticks) on Manitoulin this fall [2016],"""" said Jon Groulx, an environment support officer with the SDHU. """"There have been no confirmed human cases of Lyme disease on Manitoulin, though there have been confirmed black legged ticks and humans with Lyme disease in the SDHU catchment area"""" [While he has not confirmed any black-legged ticks, clearly, there are some in the area. Also, people and pets are mobile, so they don't have to acquire the ticks in their own neighborhoods. - Mod.TG].;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"When asked whether the high number of dog cases has led to concern at the SDHU, Mr. Groulx said: """"We regularly educate the public about how to prevent ticks and how to remove one"""" [There must be some concern, or he would not be regularly educating tick prevention. - Mod.TG]. He said that they also do tick dragging to determine whether there is an issue in an area, but that now isn't a prime time to do so. [Again, just because he is not dragging for ticks does not mean that they are not there, because we live in a mobile society that can easily bring them back to local areas from any trip. - Mod.TG].;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Mr. Groulx confirmed that there had been an increase of black legged ticks submitted for testing with the SDHU but said he couldn't speculate on this being due to a high number of ticks or people being more vigilant [If a high number have been submitted	 then the ticks are likely in the area. - Mod.TG].;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
People can submit ticks to the SDHU (locally in Mindemoya) to test whether it is a deer tick. If it is confirmed as a deer tick (black legged tick)	 it is sent for further testing to see whether it has the Lyme disease bacteria.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"To help prevent ticks and Lyme disease, we recommend people check for ticks when they come in from outdoors,"""" said Mr. Groulx. """"We also suggest people wear long sleeves and tuck their pants into their socks and wear Health Canada approved bug spray."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
To prevent ticks from biting dogs	 Dr. Mitchell suggested considering a veterinary approved safe treatment against ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"There are several that are being prescribed in the Canadian veterinary field and exist as a pill or topical treatment administered monthly to every 3 months. Also, it is wise to go through your dog's coat with a fine-tooth comb, a flea comb, after any outdoor hikes to look for ticks and remove promptly,"""" said Dr. Mitchell. """"The sooner you remove, the less time for Lyme transmission. To remove a tick, simply grasp it with tweezers close to its attachment to the skin and gently twist until the tick dislodges. You must make sure that the entire tick, head and body is removed. Finally, for dogs visiting endemic areas of Lyme disease in Ontario, there are newer vaccines that have emerged."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Ms. Mitchell recommended visiting <http://www.oahn.ca> for more information about the prevalence of Lyme disease in Ontario and also noted that any questions will be welcomed at either vet clinic on the island.;;;;;;;;;;

[Lyme disease is caused by 4 main species of bacteria: _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 _B. mayonii_	 _B. afzelii_	 and _B. garinii_. _B. burgdorferi_ and _B. mayonii_ cause Lyme disease in the United States	 while _B. afzelii_	 and _B. garinii_ are the leading causes of Lyme disease in Europe and Asia. The most common tickborne illness in these regions	 Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected black-legged tick	 commonly known as a deer tick.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease in pets;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
----------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is transmitted to dogs through the bite of a tick. Once in the bloodstream	 the Lyme disease organism is carried to many parts of the body and is likely to localize in joints. It was 1st thought that only a few types of ticks could transmit this disease	 but now it appears that several common species may be involved. The most common type of tick to carry Lyme disease is the deer tick or black-legged tick.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
If pets are diagnosed with Lyme disease	 they cannot transmit it to people	 but the tick must bite the person.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Symptoms of Lyme disease are more difficult to detect in animals than in people. The characteristic rash does not develop in dogs or cats. Because the other symptoms of the disease may be delayed or go unrecognized and because the symptoms are similar to those of many other diseases	 Lyme disease in animals is often not considered until other diseases have been eliminated.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Many dogs affected with Lyme disease are taken to a veterinarian because they seem to be experiencing generalized pain and have stopped eating. Affected dogs have been described as if they were """"walking on eggshells."""" Often these pets have high fevers. Dogs may also begin limping. This painful lameness often appears suddenly and may shift from one leg to another. If untreated, it may eventually disappear, only to recur weeks or months later.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Some pets are infected with the Lyme disease organism for over a year before they finally show signs. By this time	 the disease may be widespread throughout the body.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dogs with lameness	 swollen joints	 and fever are suspected of having Lyme disease. However	 other diseases may also cause these symptoms. There are 2 blood tests that may be used for confirmation. The 1st is an antibody test. This test does not detect the actual spirochete in the blood but does detect the presence of antibodies created by exposure to the organism. A test can be falsely negative if the dog is infected but has not yet formed antibodies	 or if it never forms enough antibodies to cause a positive reaction. This may occur in animals with suppressed immune systems. Some dogs that have been infected for long periods of time may no longer have enough antibodies present to be detected by the test. Therefore	 a positive test is meaningful	 but a negative is not.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The 2nd test is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test	 a DNA test that is very specific and sensitive. However	 not all dogs have the spirochete in their blood cells. If a blood sample is tested	 a false negative may occur. The best sample for PCR testing is the fluid from an affected joint.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Because the Lyme spirochete is a bacterium	 it can be controlled by antibiotics. However	 a lengthy course of treatment is necessary to completely eradicate the organism. The initial antibiotic selected to treat an infected pet may not be effective against the disease	 especially if the infection is long-standing. In this situation	 changing to another antibiotic is often effective. Occasionally	 the initial infection will recur	 or the pet will become re-infected by being bitten by another infected tick.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The key to prevention is keeping your dog from being exposed to ticks. Ticks are found in grassy	 wooded	 and sandy areas. They find their way onto an animal by climbing to the top of a leaf	 blade of grass	 or short trees	 especially cedar trees. Here they wait until their sensors detect an approaching animal on which to crawl or drop. Keeping animals from thick underbrush reduces their exposure to ticks. Dogs should be kept on trails when walked near wooded or tall grass areas. Vaccination against Lyme disease is recommended for pets that live in endemic areas or that travel to areas where Lyme disease is prevalent.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Check your pet immediately after it has been in a tick-infected area. The deer tick is a small tick and only about pinhead size in juvenile stage	 but a little more obvious in adult phase and after feeding. If you find a tick moving on your pet	 the tick has not fed. Remove the tick promptly and place it in rubbing alcohol or crush it between two solid surfaces. If you find a tick attached to your pet	 grasp the tick with fine tweezers or your finger nails near the dog's skin and firmly pull it straight out. Make sure you protect your fingers from exposure by using a tissue or a disposable glove. You may need another person to help restrain your dog. Removing the tick quickly is important since the disease does not appear to be transmitted until the tick has fed for approximately 12 hours. If you crush the tick	 do not get the tick's contents	 including blood	 on your skin. The spirochete that causes Lyme disease can pass through a wound or cut in your skin.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A safe and effective vaccine is available for protecting dogs against Lyme disease. This vaccine is initially given twice	 at 2- to 3-week intervals. Annual revaccination is necessary to maintain immunity. Vaccination against Lyme disease will be determined by your pet's lifestyle and individual risk assessment. Be sure to discuss any questions you may have regarding the type and frequency of vaccination with your veterinarian.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There are also topical products and oral products to prevent fleas and ticks. Some products include Bravecto	 NexGuard	 and Advantix.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The best prevention may be a combination of vaccination	 topical	 or oral products and frequent and thorough examinations of your pet for ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease in people;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
----------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The signs and symptoms of Lyme disease vary and usually appear in stages.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A small	 red bump often appears at the site of a tick bite or tick removal and resolves over a few days. This is normal after a tick bite and does not indicate Lyme disease. However	 these signs and symptoms may occur within a month after you've been infected:;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Early signs and symptoms;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
- Rash. From 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bite	 an expanding red area might appear that sometimes clears in the center	 forming a bull's-eye pattern. The rash (erythema migrans) expands slowly over days and can spread to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across. It is typically not itchy or painful.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Erythema migrans is one of the hallmarks of Lyme disease. Some people develop this rash at more than one place on their bodies.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 chills	 fatigue	 body aches	 and a headache may accompany the rash.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Later signs and symptoms;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
If untreated	 new signs and symptoms of Lyme infection might appear in the following weeks to months. These include:;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NOM?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 but the pain can shift from one joint to another.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 months	 or even years after infection	 you might develop inflammation of the membranes surrounding your brain (meningitis)	 temporary paralysis of one side of your face (Bell's palsy)	 numbness or weakness in your limbs	 and impaired muscle movement.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Signs and symptoms caused by the bacterium _B. mayonii_ may also include nausea and vomiting	 and diffuse rashes (rather than a single bull's-eye rash commonly associated with Lyme disease);;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Several weeks after infection	 some people develop:;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 such as an irregular heartbeat. Heart problems rarely last more than a few days or weeks.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NOM?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
- Liver inflammation (hepatitis).;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NOM?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Only a minority of blacklegged tick bites lead to Lyme disease. The longer the tick remains attached to your skin	 the greater your risk of getting the disease. Lyme infection is unlikely if the tick is attached for less than 36 to 48 hours.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
If you think you've been bitten and have signs and symptoms of Lyme disease -- particularly if you live in an area where Lyme disease is prevalent -- contact your doctor. Treatment for Lyme disease is more effective if begun early.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
See your doctor even if symptoms disappear. It's important to consult your doctor even if signs and symptoms disappear -- the absence of symptoms doesn't mean the disease is gone. Left untreated	 Lyme disease can spread to other parts of your body from several months to years after infection	 causing arthritis and nervous system problems. Ticks also can transmit other illnesses	 such as babesiosis and Colorado tick fever.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Left untreated	 Lyme disease can cause:;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 particularly of the knee.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 such as facial palsy and neuropathy.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 such as impaired memory.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NOM?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The variable signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are nonspecific and often are found in other conditions	 so diagnosis can be difficult. What's more	 the ticks that transmit Lyme disease also can spread other diseases at the same time.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
If you don't have the characteristic Lyme disease rash	 your doctor might ask about your medical history	 including whether you've been outdoors in the summer where Lyme disease is common	 and do a physical exam.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Diagnosis;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
---------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lab tests to identify antibodies to the bacteria can help confirm the diagnosis. These tests are most reliable a few weeks after an infection	 after your body has had time to develop antibodies. They include:;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 ELISA detects antibodies to _B. burgdorferi_. But because it can sometimes provide false-positive results	 it's not used as the sole basis for diagnosis. This test might not be positive during the early stage of Lyme disease	 but the rash is distinctive enough to make the diagnosis without further testing in people who live in areas infested with ticks that transmit Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 this test is usually done to confirm the diagnosis. In this 2-step approach	 the Western blot detects antibodies to several proteins of _B. burgdorferi_.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Treatment and drugs;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
-------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Antibiotics are used to treat Lyme disease. In general	 recovery will be quicker and more complete the sooner treatment begins.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Antibiotics;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
- Oral antibiotics. These are the standard treatment for early-stage Lyme disease. These usually include doxycycline for adults and children older than 8	 or amoxicillin or cefuroxime for adults	 younger children	 and pregnant or breast-feeding women. A 14- to 21-day course of antibiotics is usually recommended	 but some studies suggest that courses lasting 10 to 14 days are equally effective.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 your doctor might recommend treatment with an intravenous antibiotic for 14 to 28 days. This is effective in eliminating infection	 although it may take you some time to recover from your symptoms. Intravenous antibiotics can cause various side effects	 including a lower white blood cell count	 mild to severe diarrhea	 or colonization or infection with other antibiotic-resistant organisms unrelated to Lyme.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 a small number of people still have some symptoms	 such as muscle aches and fatigue. The cause of these continuing symptoms	 known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome	 is unknown	 and treating with more antibiotics doesn't help. Some experts believe that certain people who get Lyme disease are predisposed to develop an autoimmune response that contributes to their symptoms. More research is needed.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Bismacine;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Food and Drug Administration warns against the use of bismacine	 an injectable compound prescribed by some alternative medicine practitioners to treat Lyme disease. Bismacine	 also known as chromacine	 contains high levels of the metal bismuth. Although bismuth is safely used in some oral medications for stomach ulcers	 it's not approved for use in injectable form or as a treatment for Lyme disease. Bismacine can cause bismuth poisoning	 which may lead to heart and kidney failure.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Prevention;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
----------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid areas where deer ticks live	 especially wooded	 bushy areas with long grass. You can decrease your risk of getting Lyme disease with some simple precautions:;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 wear shoes	 long pants tucked into your socks	 a long-sleeved shirt	 a hat	 and gloves. Try to stick to trails and avoid walking through low bushes and long grass. Keep your dog on a leash.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
- Use insect repellents. Apply insect repellent with a 20 percent or higher concentration of DEET to your skin. Parents should apply repellant to their children	 avoiding their hands	 eyes	 and mouth. Keep in mind that chemical repellents can be toxic	 so follow directions carefully. Apply products with permethrin to clothing or buy pretreated clothing.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NOM?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 your children	 and your pets for ticks. Be especially vigilant after spending time in wooded or grassy areas. Deer ticks are often no bigger than the head of a pin	 so you may not discover them unless you search carefully.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
It's helpful to shower as soon as you come indoors. Ticks often remain on your skin for hours before attaching themselves. Showering and using a washcloth might remove unattached ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
- Don't assume you're immune. You can get Lyme disease more than once.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
- Remove a tick as soon as possible with tweezers. Gently grasp the tick near its head or mouth. Don't squeeze or crush the tick	 but pull carefully and steadily. Once you've removed the entire tick	 dispose of it and apply antiseptic to the bite area.;;;;;;;;;;

The incidence of Lyme disease on Uist is far greater than that on neighbouring islands	 according to figures gathered by BBC Gaelic News. [The Uists are a group of islands in the Outer Hebrides	 an archipelago off the west coast of Scotland. The main islands of the Outer Hebrides include Lewis and Harris	 North Uist	 Benbecula	 South Uist	 and Barra. North Uist and South Uist are linked by causeways running via Benbecula and Grimsay. For a map of the Uist islands	 see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Hebrides#/media/File:Hebridean_Terrane.png>.];;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Over the last 4 years	 a total of 165 individuals on North Uist	 South Uist	 and Benbecula have been diagnosed with the disease. In that same period	 Lewis and Harris have recorded just 1 case and Barra 3. NHS Western Isles [health board] is developing an awareness campaign for Uist.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease can cause arthritis and neurological problems if untreated. The infection can be transmitted to humans through a bite from a tick. The figures for incidence of Lyme disease on the Western Isles were provided by medical practices across the islands. The reason of the higher numbers on Uist has still to be fully understood. NHS Western Isles and other groups are investigating.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Flu-like symptoms and fatigue are often the first noticeable signs of infection. An untreated bite often shows as a distinctive red circle-like mark on a person's skin. Diagnosed cases of Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics	 but	 if left untreated	 neurological problems and joint pain can develop months or years later. Ticks are small arthropods related to spiders	 mites	 and scorpions and Britain has a number of different species. People are most likely to come across sheep ticks	 which feed on mammals and birds	 in open spaces with long grass or bracken.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Hillwalkers and climbers organisation	 Mountaineering Scotland	 regularly issues advice on how to avoid and deal with ticks. It suggests people can protect themselves better by tucking trousers into socks or wearing gaiters	 and also by making thorough checks of their bodies once back home. It recommends that these checks should be repeated over several days. If a tick is found attached to a person's skin	 it can be removed with a tick hook. If in doubt	 seek advice from a doctor	 Mountaineering Scotland says.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"NHS Western Isles said: """"We are aware of the difference in prevalence across the islands and, as geographically separate islands, we are not surprised that the patterns are different. """"There is different land use in North and South Uist as opposed to Benbecula and this may be related.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We know that some people have expressed their concerns and views about the changing patterns of deer roaming, and the overlap in certain areas of deer and croft animals."""" [A croft is a unit of agricultural land (around 12 acres/5 ha]), situated on large estates, and rented from the landowner. There are over 17 000 crofts in Scotland;"" each croft is listed in the Register of Crofts and most crofts are part of a community of crofts that share common grazing land (<http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/advice_topics/finding_a_place_to_live/crofts_and_crofting/about_crofts_and_crofting>).] The health board already supports efforts to raise awareness of ticks"	 their presence	" and how to remove and treat them. But a spokeswoman added: """"""""However"	 we are developing a targeted campaign for the Uists that will focus on prevention of bites	 tick removal	 and identification and treatment of tick-related disease in people. As tick bites tend to reduce in frequency in the winter	" this will be in place prior to the [2017] spring rise in tick prevalence."""""""""";;;;;;;;;"																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Sheep ticks feed on deer, an animal which has been increasingly appearing in villages and gardens on Uist. Scottish Natural Heritage, a public body with a responsibility for managing wild deer numbers, said it was also aware of islanders' concerns about the link between ticks and red deer. A spokesman said: """"We recognise that the deer population in Uist has increased and has been gradually using agricultural land more and moving into villages and gardens. It is a large host and, unlike domestic stock, they are untreated, therefore they play a significant role in spreading ticks into inhabited areas.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"In 2015 we brought together stakeholders to set up a voluntary Uist Deer Management Group. We have been supporting the group to develop a deer management plan which takes into account the various interests, including public benefits. This includes reducing agricultural damage, and an aspiration to reduce the tick burden, and also Lyme disease, in agricultural/inhabited areas in the Uists."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Landowner, North Uist Estate Trust, said it was important that the cause of the large number of incidence of the disease was properly understood. A spokesman said: """"We have also noticed a rise in the incidence of Lyme disease over the past 5 years and this is of major concern to us as our stalkers and gamekeepers are particularly at risk. If recent reports are to be believed there is a corresponding rise in many parts of Scotland and it is important that the underlying reasons are properly understood as we are encouraging more people into the countryside each year. Deer play a significant role in the spread of ticks and our local deer group has commissioned a deer plan that advocates a significant reduction in deer numbers. We are currently working to achieve the target cull recommended in the deer plan."""";;;;;;;;;;"

[Lyme disease is the most common human tickborne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere	 occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America	 Europe	 and Asia. Lyme disease is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete	 _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex	 a genetically diverse group of spirochetes (<http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/42/3/378.full.pdf>). Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks	 and various small- and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts. However	 the species of tick vector	 the reservoir host species	 borrelial genospecies	 and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. The patterns of disease also differ by geographical location. For example	 acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and neuroborreliosis are more common in Europe	 whereas arthritis appears to be prevalent in the United States.;;;;;;;;;;													
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
At least 3 species of the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex (_B. afzelii_	 _B. garinii_	 and _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto) are known to cause Lyme disease in humans. _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the most common pathogenic species to cause Lyme disease in North America. In Europe	 _B. garinii_ and _B. afzelii_ are much commoner than _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto. _Ixodes scapularis_ is the vector in the eastern and north-central United States and _Ixodes ricinus_ in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Incidence of Lyme disease acquired in England and Wales remains low compared with some other European countries or the US. Public Health England (PHE) recorded between 950 and 1050 cases annually in England and Wales (2011 to 2013)	 with an incidence of 1.8 cases per 100 000 population (<http://vscg.org/good-practice/published/ticks-and-lyme-disease>). Incidence rates are higher in Scotland; Health Protection Scotland recorded between 228 and 308 cases annually (2007 to 2011)	 with an incidence of 4.3 cases per 100 000 population (<http://vscg.org/good-practice/published/ticks-and-lyme-disease>). However	 because of under-reporting	 the true incidence is estimated to be 2-3 times higher.;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Areas inhabited by deer are particularly suitable habitats for ixodes ticks. Deer	 although not susceptible to Lyme disease	 supply the adult tick with a required blood meal.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Areas in Scotland that are particularly at risk for acquiring Lyme disease are indicated on a map that can be found at <http://d10k7sivr61qqr.cloudfront.net/content/royinterface/13/116/20160140/F2.large.jpg>.

Winter is coming	 but that doesn't mean you're out of the woods just yet as far as tick diseases are concerned.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dr. Richard Rusk	 Manitoba's Medical Officer of Health for Communicable Disease	 is advising Manitobans to be mindful of the pests this fall. In the past 2 years	 15 cases of the emerging tick diseases anaplasmosis and babesiosis have been reported to Manitoba health	 he said.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
This year [2016] is only the 2nd year Manitoba Health has been tracking the number of cases of the emerging diseases. According to Rusk	 it will take about 5 years of monitoring before we can come to any meaningful conclusions about the prevalence of these infections.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Reported cases of tick-borne illness in the past 2 years:;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease -- 70;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Anaplasmosis -- 14;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Babesiosis -- 1;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The diseases are carried by the same kind of tick that spreads Lyme disease -- called blacklegged or deer ticks -- and can co-exist in the host. In fact	 one tick carrying 2 diseases can pass on both at the same time. Rusk said a small portion of reported cases so far have been from people suffering from Lyme disease and one of the emerging infections simultaneously.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"He said blacklegged ticks are still active at this time of year and the province """"still has teams out doing surveillance. Blacklegged ticks will be a threat until there's frost consistently,"""" Rusk said. """"If you're out in Birds Hill, Labarrière Park and Pembina Valley, it's still very possible to get ticks."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Anaplasmosis. Symptoms can start 5 to 21 days after a tick bite and may include fever	 chills	 headache	 joint aches	 nausea and vomiting	 often in association with blood abnormalities and/or liver abnormalities. Anaplasmosis can be successfully treated with antibiotics.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Babesiosis. Symptoms can start 1 to 6 weeks after a tick bite and may include non-specific flu-like symptoms such as fever	 chills	 sweats	 headache	 body aches	 loss of appetite	 nausea or fatigue. Babesiosis can also be successfully treated with antibiotics.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease. Symptoms can start about 3 days to 1 month after a tick bite	 often with an expanding rash	 which then fades. Early symptoms can also include headache	 stiff neck	 muscle aches or fatigue	 fever	 chills and swollen lymph nodes. Lyme disease can be successfully treated with antibiotics and treatment is most successful in the early stages of infection.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
People who think they may have anaplasmosis	 babesiosis or Lyme disease should see their doctor. For more information	 contact Health Links-Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.;;;;;;;;;;

The number of cases of the tick-borne bacterial infection	 anaplasmosis	 are up significantly in the state of Maine	 according to data from the state's Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Through 18 Aug [2016]	 the Maine CDC has reported 228 anaplasmosis cases. This compares to 186 cases in all of 2015. More than half the cases have been reported from the Mid-Coast region	 mostly in Knox and Lincoln counties.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Maine CDC is also reporting 49 cases of the tick-borne parasitic infection	 babesiosis	 through mid-August [2016]. This compares to 55 cases reported all of last year [2015].;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In addition	 health officials have reported 11 co-infections -- 4 co-infections with anaplasmosis and Lyme disease	 2 co-infections with babesiosis and Lyme disease and 5 co-infections with anaplasmosis and babesiosis.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Maine CDC says current data for Lyme disease is not available; however	 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported a cumulative total through 20 Aug [2016] of 479 Lyme disease cases in Maine.;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The organism that causes this disease is called _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_. It is an intracellular pathogen that is part of the _Rickettsia_ (the same group of bacteria that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever amongst other diseases) family. Formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis	 and as the former name of the disease implies	 it's an infection of the white blood cells [specifically granulocytes].;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
People get this infection through the bite of an infected tick. Depending on the part of the United States you are	 the tick species is different: the eastern part of the country is the black-legged tick	 _Ixodes scapularis_	 and in the western part of the country	 _Ixodes pacificus_ is usually involved. These are deer ticks that are also involved in the transmission of Lyme disease [and babesiosis].;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;

After a period of a couple of days to a few weeks	 most people infected with _Anaplasma_ show influenza-like symptoms (fever	 malaise	 headache	 nausea	 vomiting	 diarrhea and respiratory symptoms such as a cough). Symptoms tend to be more severe in those [who] are immunosuppressed and the elderly.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The case fatality rate (i.e.	 the proportion of anaplasmosis patients that reportedly died as a result of infection) has remained low	 at less than 1 percent.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Because _A. phagocytophilum_ infects the white blood cells and circulates in the blood stream	 this pathogen may pose a risk to be transmitted through blood transfusions. _A. phagocytophilum_ has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Doxycycline is the 1st line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever anaplasmosis is suspected.;;;;;;;;;;

Physicians in Switzerland have seen a sharp increase in the number of tick bites as well as cases of Lyme disease this year [2016]. As of the end of July [2016]	 doctors across the nation had treated 22 000 people for tick bites. In comparison	 the whole of 2015 saw just 14 300 visits	 according to the Federal Office of Public Health. The figure is the highest since the office started recording tick bite cases in 2008.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The high number of tick bites is also associated with a higher number of Lyme disease cases. So far this year [2016] there have been 8400 cases of acute Lyme disease. In 2015 the figure was 5300	 and there were 8700 cases in 2013 -- considered a particularly bad year for tick-related illnesses.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Meanwhile	 119 people have contracted tick-borne encephalitis this year [2016]. In recent years	 the annual figures have fluctuated between 40 and 170 cases. There is a vaccination for tick-borne encephalitis	 but not for Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Mild temperatures in January and February gave the tick season a jump start this year [2016]. Ticks are active from 7 deg C [44.6 deg F], and their """"high season"""" is typically May and June. The most common type of tick found in Switzerland is the wood tick, also known as the American dog tick [but dog ticks/wood ticks are not known to transmit Lyme disease - Mod.LM].;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Swiss league for patients with tick-borne diseases recommends that people prevent tick bites by avoiding bushes and tall grass	 by wearing clothing that covers the arms	 legs	 and feet	 and by checking the body carefully for ticks and their larvae.;;;;;;;;;;

[Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere	 occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America	 Europe	 and Asia. It is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete	 _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex	 a genetically diverse group of spirochetes (<http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/42/3/378.full.pdf>). Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks	 and various small- and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The species of tick	 the host species	 borrelial genospecies	 and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. The patterns of disease also differ by geographical location. For example	 acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and neuroborreliosis are more common in Europe	 whereas arthritis appears to be prevalent in the United States.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
At least 3 species of the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex (_B. afzelii_	 _B. garinii_	 and _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto) are known to cause Lyme disease in humans	 although _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the most common pathogenic species to cause Lyme disease in North America. It also occurs in Europe	 but is less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_	 the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Individual ticks can be infected with more than one genospecies of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex. In Europe	 _B. burgdorferi_ genospecies that cause Lyme borreliosis are mainly transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. In a literature review of studies of the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato in _I. ricinus_ ticks in various European countries	 the overall mean prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_-infected ticks was 13.7 percent (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/>): Regions with the highest infection rates are located in central Europe (Austria	 Czech Republic	 southern Germany	 Switzerland	 Slovakia	 and Slovenia); The infection rate in adult ticks (18.6 percent ) was considerably higher infection rate than in nymphs (10.1 percent). In Switzerland	 13.6 to 49 percent of ticks were infected. In the Austria/Switzerland region	 of positive ticks	 25 percent were infected with _B. afzelii_	 44 percent with _B. garinii_	 and 25 percent with _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto. No significant difference was seen when the prevalence of each _Borrelia_ species in nymphs was compared to that in adults (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/>). - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There were 159 cases of Lyme disease reported last year [2015] -- a sharp rise from 32 cases in 2011.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lyme disease has been in progression in Quebec for several years already but remains quite unknown to the population,"""" said Doctor Arruda. After an outdoor activity, it is recommended to check your skin for ticks. If bitten, it is crucial to gently remove the tick with a pair of tweezers within 24 hours. Do not use your fingers because you risk crushing the tick, which would speed the spread of the disease. When removed, the tick should be placed in a sealed container for analysis in case of an infection. Then, clean your skin with soap and water and wash your hands well.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
People are recommended to wear light-coloured long sleeves and pants when visiting woodland areas and high vegetation environments in the months of April to November. It is also preferable to walk along paths and avoid threading through tall grass. Carrying a can of DEET or icaridin-based insect repellant can be a boon for exposed areas of the skin	 save for the face.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
If symptoms such as a rash	 fever	 headache	 fatigue	 neck stiffness and muscle or joint pain occur within a month after getting bit	 call Info-Santé at 8-1-1 or see a doctor.;;;;;;;;;;

[Quebec is a province in eastern Canada. In 2014	 ProMED-mail reported on the increasing incidence of Lyme disease in the Canadian province of Quebec	 mainly concentrated in Montérégie	 an administrative region in the southern portion of the province south of the St. Laurence River	 between the city of Montreal and the U.S. state of New York	 where Lyme disease is known to be endemic. The news report above mentions Montérégie again	 plus the adjacent administrative regions of Estrie and Centre-du-Québec	 where the report above says there is a risk of contracting Lyme disease. In 2013	 142 cases of Lyme disease were reported in the province (<http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/lyme-disease-cases-popping-up-in-quebec-1.1911196>) and the news report above says that there were 159 cases of Lyme disease reported last year [2015] and 32 cases in 2011. ;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Two confirmed canine cases of Lyme disease have been diagnosed in 2 weeks at Fall River Veterinary Hospital [Nova Scotia]	 pointing to an uptick in the illness among pets.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The tick _Ixodes scapularis_ is commonly known as the deer tick or blacklegged tick and can transmit Lyme disease to dogs or humans	 but has to latch on and feed for up to 48 hours in order to do so. The bacterium transmitted by the tick is _Borrelia burgdorferi_.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We're seeing an increase in tick numbers every year,"""" said Dr Ainsley Davidson-Rowe, who confirmed the most recent case Tuesday morning [31 May 2016].;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We're seeing them in more and more areas in the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) -- they're definitely spreading. There are no areas in HRM I would call tick-free, so everyone has to be on the lookout,"""" she said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We're going to be seeing increases in diagnoses in people and pets."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The signs of Lyme disease can be very vague -- you might just think it's stiffness (in your dog)	 or old age	 but in reality that dog could be Lyme positive	 she said.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The most important message is that, for dogs, we have a really effective and safe tick prevention. We can put them on medication that keeps ticks off them. If we can keep ticks off, we cut the odds of a dog bringing ticks into the house,"""" she said, citing the use of Bravecto. Nexgard is another such product.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is spread through the long-term latch-on from a black-legged tick. Ticks are typically found in wooded areas and in tall grass areas. They can also be found in yards.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Cats are very resistant to Lyme disease	 but can still get ticks on them	 she said.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We also have a vaccine for Lyme disease, but tick prevention is the most important aspect, as a tick that doesn't attach/feed can't pass on Lyme,"""" she said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Cases of the Lyme disease the blood-sucker carries are on the rise among Nova Scotians	 with colonies firmly entrenched in 6 areas around the province and their populations rising everywhere	 according to the latest stats available from Health & Wellness.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
From 2002 to 2014	 there were a total of 443 cases of Lyme disease reported in Nova Scotia. In 2014 alone	 there were 114 cases reported	 according to Health & Wellness numbers.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Elaine Holmes	 director of communicable disease prevention and control for the Nova Scotia Department of Health & Wellness	 recommended preventative measures for families at work or play.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"If folks are out and about in wooded areas, tall grass, or shrubbed areas, they need to wear enclosed shoes, cover their skin as much as possible,"""" she said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Holmes recommends the use of an insect repellant that contains DEET	 but to pay strict attention to directions	 particularly in respect to children.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
It's important to check yourself	 children	 and pets on return from spending time outdoors.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
While various Internet sources recommend everything from fingernail polish to unscrewing a tick to remove it once it's embedded	 Holmes said the best way is to remove it directly and carefully.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Use tweezers, as close to possible to where the tick is embedded in the skin, and gently pull it straight out,"""" she said, adding it's important not to jerk, squeeze, or twist the tick while you're pulling it out. Put the removed tick inside a ziplock-style bag and put it in the garbage.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Once it's removed	 wash the area with hot soapy water or hydrogen peroxide. If part of the tick breaks off under the skin	 seek the help of your health care provider in pulling it out	 Holmes said.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"In Nova Scotia, we really would like our citizens to enjoy our outdoors and enjoy them safely,"""" she said.;;;;;;;;;;"

[Lyme disease is caused by 4 main species of bacteria: _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 _B. mayonii_	 _B. afzelii_	 and _B. garinii_. _B. burgdorferi_ and _B. mayonii_ cause Lyme disease in the United States	 while _B. afzelii_	 and _B. garinii_ are the leading causes of Lyme disease in Europe and Asia. The most common tickborne illness in these regions	 Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected black-legged tick	 commonly known as a deer tick.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease in pets;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
--------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is transmitted to dogs through the bite of a tick. Once in the blood stream	 the Lyme disease organism is carried to many parts of the body and is likely to localize in joints. It was first thought that only a few types of ticks could transmit this disease	 but now it appears that several common species may be involved. The most common type of tick to carry Lyme disease is the deer tick or black-legged tick.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
If pets are diagnosed with Lyme disease	 they cannot transmit it to people	 but the tick must bite the person.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Symptoms of Lyme disease are more difficult to detect in animals than in people. The characteristic rash does not develop in dogs or cats. Because the other symptoms of the disease may be delayed or go unrecognized and because the symptoms are similar to those of many other diseases	 Lyme disease in animals is often not considered until other diseases have been eliminated.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Many dogs affected with Lyme disease are taken to a veterinarian because they seem to be experiencing generalized pain and have stopped eating. Affected dogs have been described as if they were """"walking on eggshells."""" Often these pets have high fevers. Dogs may also begin limping. This painful lameness often appears suddenly and may shift from one leg to another. If untreated, it may eventually disappear, only to recur weeks or months later.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Some pets are infected with the Lyme disease organism for over a year before they finally show signs. By this time	 the disease may be widespread throughout the body.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dogs with lameness	 swollen joints	 and fever are suspected of having Lyme disease. However	 other diseases may also cause these symptoms. There are 2 blood tests that may be used for confirmation. The 1st is an antibody test. This test does not detect the actual spirochete in the blood but does detect the presence of antibodies created by exposure to the organism. A test can be falsely negative if the dog is infected but has not yet formed antibodies	 or if it never forms enough antibodies to cause a positive reaction. This may occur in animals with suppressed immune systems. Some dogs that have been infected for long periods of time may no longer have enough antibodies present to be detected by the test. Therefore	 a positive test is meaningful	 but a negative is not.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The 2nd test is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test	 a DNA test that is very specific and sensitive. However	 not all dogs have the spirochete in their blood cells. If a blood sample is tested	 a false negative may occur. The best sample for PCR testing is the fluid from an affected joint.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Because the Lyme spirochete is a bacterium	 it can be controlled by antibiotics. However	 a lengthy course of treatment is necessary to completely eradicate the organism. The initial antibiotic selected to treat an infected pet may not be effective against the disease	 especially if the infection is long-standing. In this situation	 changing to another antibiotic is often effective. Occasionally	 the initial infection will recur	 or the pet will become re-infected by being bitten by another infected tick.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The key to prevention is keeping your dog from being exposed to ticks. Ticks are found in grassy	 wooded	 and sandy areas. They find their way onto an animal by climbing to the top of a leaf	 blade of grass	 or short trees	 especially cedar trees. Here they wait until their sensors detect an approaching animal on which to crawl or drop. Keeping animals from thick underbrush reduces their exposure to ticks. Dogs should be kept on trails when walked near wooded or tall grass areas. Vaccination against Lyme disease is recommended for pets that live in endemic areas or that travel to areas where Lyme disease is prevalent.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Check your pet immediately after it has been in a tick-infected area. The deer tick is a small tick and only about pinhead size in juvenile stage	 but a little more obvious in adult phase and after feeding. If you find a tick moving on your pet	 the tick has not fed. Remove the tick promptly and place it in rubbing alcohol or crush it between two solid surfaces. If you find a tick attached to your pet	 grasp the tick with fine tweezers or your finger nails near the dog's skin and firmly pull it straight out. Make sure you protect your fingers from exposure by using a tissue or a disposable glove. You may need another person to help restrain your dog. Removing the tick quickly is important since the disease does not appear to be transmitted until the tick has fed for approximately 12 hours. If you crush the tick	 do not get the tick's contents	 including blood	 on your skin. The spirochete that causes Lyme disease can pass through a wound or cut in your skin.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A safe and effective vaccine is available for protecting dogs against Lyme disease. This vaccine is initially given twice	 at 2- to 3-week intervals. Annual revaccination is necessary to maintain immunity. Vaccination against Lyme disease will be determined by your pet's lifestyle and individual risk assessment. Be sure to discuss any questions you may have regarding the type and frequency of vaccination with your veterinarian.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There are also topical products and oral products to prevent fleas and ticks. Some products include Bravecto	 NexGuard	 and Advantix.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The best prevention may be a combination of vaccination	 topical	 or oral products and frequent and thorough examinations of your pet for ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease in people;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
----------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The signs and symptoms of Lyme disease vary and usually appear in stages.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A small	 red bump often appears at the site of a tick bite or tick removal and resolves over a few days. This is normal after a tick bite and does not indicate Lyme disease. However	 these signs and symptoms may occur within a month after you've been infected:;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Early signs and symptoms;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
- Rash. From 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bite	 an expanding red area might appear that sometimes clears in the center	 forming a bull's-eye pattern. The rash (erythema migrans) expands slowly over days and can spread to 12 inches (30 centimeters) across. It is typically not itchy or painful.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Erythema migrans is one of the hallmarks of Lyme disease. Some people develop this rash at more than one place on their bodies.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 chills	 fatigue	 body aches	 and a headache may accompany the rash.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Later signs and symptoms;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
If untreated	 new signs and symptoms of Lyme infection might appear in the following weeks to months. These include:;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NOM?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 but the pain can shift from one joint to another.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 months	 or even years after infection	 you might develop inflammation of the membranes surrounding your brain (meningitis)	 temporary paralysis of one side of your face (Bell's palsy)	 numbness or weakness in your limbs	 and impaired muscle movement.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Signs and symptoms caused by the bacterium _B. mayonii_ may also include nausea and vomiting	 and diffuse rashes (rather than a single bull's-eye rash commonly associated with Lyme disease);;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Several weeks after infection	 some people develop:;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 such as an irregular heartbeat. Heart problems rarely last more than a few days or weeks.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NOM?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
- Liver inflammation (hepatitis).;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NOM?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Only a minority of blacklegged tick bites leads to Lyme disease. The longer the tick remains attached to your skin	 the greater your risk of getting the disease. Lyme infection is unlikely if the tick is attached for less than 36 to 48 hours.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
If you think you've been bitten and have signs and symptoms of Lyme disease -- particularly if you live in an area where Lyme disease is prevalent -- contact your doctor. Treatment for Lyme disease is more effective if begun early.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
See your doctor even if symptoms disappear. It's important to consult your doctor even if signs and symptoms disappear -- the absence of symptoms doesn't mean the disease is gone. Left untreated	 Lyme disease can spread to other parts of your body from several months to years after infection	 causing arthritis and nervous system problems. Ticks also can transmit other illnesses	 such as babesiosis and Colorado tick fever.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Left untreated	 Lyme disease can cause:;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 particularly of the knee.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 such as facial palsy and neuropathy.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 such as impaired memory.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NOM?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The variable signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are nonspecific and often are found in other conditions	 so diagnosis can be difficult. What's more	 the ticks that transmit Lyme disease also can spread other diseases at the same time.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
If you don't have the characteristic Lyme disease rash	 your doctor might ask about your medical history	 including whether you've been outdoors in the summer where Lyme disease is common	 and do a physical exam.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Diagnosis;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
---------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lab tests to identify antibodies to the bacteria can help confirm the diagnosis. These tests are most reliable a few weeks after an infection	 after your body has had time to develop antibodies. They include:;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 ELISA detects antibodies to _B. burgdorferi_. But because it can sometimes provide false-positive results	 it's not used as the sole basis for diagnosis. This test might not be positive during the early stage of Lyme disease	 but the rash is distinctive enough to make the diagnosis without further testing in people who live in areas infested with ticks that transmit Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 this test is usually done to confirm the diagnosis. In this 2-step approach	 the Western blot detects antibodies to several proteins of _B. burgdorferi_.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Treatment and drugs;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
-------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Antibiotics are used to treat Lyme disease. In general	 recovery will be quicker and more complete the sooner treatment begins.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Antibiotics;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
- Oral antibiotics. These are the standard treatment for early-stage Lyme disease. These usually include doxycycline for adults and children older than 8	 or amoxicillin or cefuroxime for adults	 younger children	 and pregnant or breast-feeding women. A 14- to 21-day course of antibiotics is usually recommended	 but some studies suggest that courses lasting 10 to 14 days are equally effective.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 your doctor might recommend treatment with an intravenous antibiotic for 14 to 28 days. This is effective in eliminating infection	 although it may take you some time to recover from your symptoms. Intravenous antibiotics can cause various side effects	 including a lower white blood cell count	 mild to severe diarrhea	 or colonization or infection with other antibiotic-resistant organisms unrelated to Lyme.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 a small number of people still have some symptoms	 such as muscle aches and fatigue. The cause of these continuing symptoms	 known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome	 is unknown	 and treating with more antibiotics doesn't help. Some experts believe that certain people who get Lyme disease are predisposed to develop an autoimmune response that contributes to their symptoms. More research is needed.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Bismacine;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Food and Drug Administration warns against the use of bismacine	 an injectable compound prescribed by some alternative medicine practitioners to treat Lyme disease. Bismacine	 also known as chromacine	 contains high levels of the metal bismuth. Although bismuth is safely used in some oral medications for stomach ulcers	 it's not approved for use in injectable form or as a treatment for Lyme disease. Bismacine can cause bismuth poisoning	 which may lead to heart and kidney failure.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Prevention;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
----------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid areas where deer ticks live	 especially wooded	 bushy areas with long grass. You can decrease your risk of getting Lyme disease with some simple precautions:;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 wear shoes	 long pants tucked into your socks	 a long-sleeved shirt	 a hat	 and gloves. Try to stick to trails and avoid walking through low bushes and long grass. Keep your dog on a leash.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
- Use insect repellents. Apply insect repellent with a 20 percent or higher concentration of DEET to your skin. Parents should apply repellant to their children	 avoiding their hands	 eyes	 and mouth. Keep in mind that chemical repellents can be toxic	 so follow directions carefully. Apply products with permethrin to clothing or buy pretreated clothing.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NOM?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 your children	 and your pets for ticks. Be especially vigilant after spending time in wooded or grassy areas. Deer ticks are often no bigger than the head of a pin	 so you may not discover them unless you search carefully.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
It's helpful to shower as soon as you come indoors. Ticks often remain on your skin for hours before attaching themselves. Showering and using a washcloth might remove unattached ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
- Don't assume you're immune. You can get Lyme disease more than once.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
- Remove a tick as soon as possible with tweezers. Gently grasp the tick near its head or mouth. Don't squeeze or crush the tick	 but pull carefully and steadily. Once you've removed the entire tick	 dispose of it and apply antiseptic to the bite area.;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The number of cases of Lyme disease in pets has increased by 560 percent since 2009	 new data suggests	 with warmer winters thought to be to blame for a surge in the tick-borne infection. ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The figures	 from vets charity PDSA [The People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]	 suggest the disease is becoming increasingly common in animals as well as in humans. The charity said it had seen 99 cases of suspected or confirmed Lyme disease last year at its 51 hospitals alone -- almost 7 times the number seen in 2009	 when it recorded just 15 cases.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The vast majority of the cases were in dogs, though the disease can also affect cats. The PDSA said the figures were likely to be just the """"tip of the iceberg"""" with thousands more cases likely to be treated by other veterinarians, or going undiagnosed. The figures mirror the surge seen in human cases, with NHS [National Health Service] data showing a quadrupling in the number of diagnosed cases in the 12 years to 2013. The NHS has said the rise in cases of Lyme disease is thought to be """"driven by climate change, leading to warmer winters"""".;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Vicki Larkham-Jones, a PDSA vet, said the increase in cases it had seen was """"incredibly worrying"""". """"Lyme disease can be a very serious, debilitating condition that can cause long-term problems if left untreated,"""" she said. """"Caught early, the disease can usually be effectively treated with long-term antibiotics. However, owners may not even be aware that their animal has been bitten by a tick, so they need to be vigilant."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is caused by ticks	 tiny parasites found in long grass or woodland that feed on blood. It is thought that their numbers may be increasing as climate change brings warmer winters.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The PDSA said symptoms in pets could be similar to those in humans and included """"fever, pain and swelling in the joints, crippling arthritis, nerve damage and even meningitis"""". Symptoms typically take at least 2 months to materialise, it added, but can be successfully treated with antibiotics. However, the majority of tick bites do not cause the disease, the charity added. """"We treated 2545 pets for tick related issues, including bites or removal in 2015 and only around 100 of these cases were suspected or confirmed cases of Lyme disease,"""" Ms Larkham-Jones said. """"Now is the time for vigilance, as the UK's tick population peaks between late spring and autumn."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Although there is no evidence of Lyme disease being transmitted directly from person to person or from pets to humans	 an infected tick could potentially move from a pet to a human and infect them	 the PDSA said. It is estimated that there are about 2000 to 3000 new cases of Lyme disease in humans each year in the UK.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The disease can often be treated effectively if detected early	 but if left untreated can cause severe chronic symptoms. A number of celebrities who suffer from the disease	 including Phones4U founder	 John Caudwell	 have gone public with their illness in recent years	 raising awareness of its potentially debilitating effects.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
As well as climate change and warmer winters	 other factors thought to increase the prevalence of Lyme disease include growing numbers of housing developments in rural areas.;;;;;;;;;;

Q&A: Lyme disease in pets;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Q. What is Lyme disease?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A. A bacterial infection	 [also called] Lyme borreliosis	 which is spread to humans and animals by infected ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Q. How can I protect my pets?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A. The PDSA advises avoiding letting dogs wander in long grasses in areas where Lyme disease is known to be a problem	 and checking them for ticks when they come back from walks. Ticks are most commonly found on pets' heads	 ears	 legs and underside. Ticks should be removed properly as soon as possible as the risk of Lyme disease increases the longer the tick remains.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Q. How do I remove a tick?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A. Special tick tweezers are advised as otherwise the mouth of the tick can remain in the skin	 causing an infection. Do not crush or squeeze the tick's body.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Q. What are the symptoms [in humans]?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A. Lyme disease can cause a rash	 a raised temperature	 lack of energy	 lameness	 due to joint inflammation	 and swollen lymph nodes.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Q. Can I catch it from my pet?;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A. Not directly. Lyme disease is spread by infected ticks	 not from pet to person. However	 an infected tick could potentially crawl from an animal to a person in contact with them.;;;;;;;;;;

[Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and is spread by ticks. It affects a variety of species	 including dogs	 cats	 and people. Up to 95 percent of dogs infected with _B. burgdorferi_ do not develop clinical signs (people are much more likely to become ill with Lyme disease). The disease/pathogen are not listed by the OIE.;;;;;;;;;;

[The following has been mostly extracted from my moderator comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Lyme disease - UK: Borrelia positive ticks 20120128.1024838:;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere	 occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America	 Europe and Asia. It is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete	 _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato group. The major genospecies causing disease in humans are _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu stricto	 _Borrelia garnii_ and _Borrelia afzelii_. Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks	 and various small and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts. ;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The species of tick	 the host species	 borrelial genospecies and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the predominant pathogenic species identified in North America. It also occurs in Europe but is much less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_	 the two major European pathogenic genospecies. All these genospecies are present in the United Kingdom (U.K.)	 but _B. garinii_ appears to be the most prevalent pathogenic genospecies in most endemic areas of the U.K. (<http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140714084352/http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1309968694565>).;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The different pathogenic genospecies can cause variations in manifestations of Lyme disease. _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is particularly associated with arthritic and neurological complications	 _B. garinii_ with neurological presentations and _B. afzelii_ with the uncommon late skin manifestation	 acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and an associated peripheral neuropathy.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In Europe	 _B. burgdorferi_ genospecies that cause Lyme borreliosis are mainly transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. In a literature review of studies of the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato in _I. ricinus_ ticks in various European countries	 the overall mean prevalence of _B. burgdorferi _ in ticks was 13.7%; For the UK the prevalence ranged from 3.9 to 8.5 (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/>). ;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Increases in incidence of Lyme disease are likely the result of several factors that include: 1) greater recognition	 2) improved reporting	 as well as 3) a true increase in disease incidence due to: more people living in suburban neighborhoods near wooded areas with enlarging populations of deer (which	 although not susceptible to Lyme disease	 supply the adult tick with a required blood meal); enlarging populations of the reservoirs for Lyme disease; increasing frequency of spirochete-infected nymphal _Ixodes_; and climatic conditions that favor proliferation of the tick	 reservoir hosts	 and deer populations.  ;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is endemic in many parts of the U.K.	 particularly in woodland and heath-land areas	 and occasional cases are acquired in peri-urban parks and recreational areas with suitable habitat. In the U.K.	 the mean annual incidence rates for laboratory-confirmed cases have risen from 0.06 per 100	000 total population for the period 1986 to 1992	 to 0.64 cases per 100 000 total population in 2002	 to 1.1 cases per 100 000 total population in 2005 (<http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140714084352/http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1309968694565>). - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
The reported incidence for confirmed Lyme disease in the US for 2014	 the most recent year for which data are available	 is 25 359 (incidence rate 7.9 per 100 000) (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/tables.html>). The reported incidence for Lyme disease given in the news report for Finland in 2015 is 1900 (about 35 per 100 000); this incidence rate in Finland is over 4-fold higher than the reported US incidence rate	 as Dr Berger points out.;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
However	 the CDC estimates that the total number of people who develop Lyme disease each year in the US is actually 10 times higher than the yearly reported number or 253 590 (79 per 100 000) for 2014 (<http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0819-lyme-disease.html>). The news report says that one estimate for the actual number of Lyme cases in Finland in 2015 is 4000-5000 (74-93 per 100 000) and another estimate is 8000 (148 per 100 000)	 that is	 the estimates for the actual yearly incidence rate of Lyme cases in Finland may be up to almost 2-fold higher than the estimate for the actual incidence rate of Lyme cases in the US. - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;;;

Lyme disease	 which is also known as Lyme borreliosis	 is an infectious disease spread by bacteria-carrying ticks. When a person is infected	 a circular rash develops around the bite area of the skin about a week after the bite. Milder	 early symptoms can include headache and fever	 but left untreated	 the disease can cause partial facial paralysis	 joint pain and a variety of other symptoms. There is also ongoing research that left untreated	 the disease has the potential to develop into a chronic illness.;;;;;;;;;;																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Jarmo Oksi, a specialist in infectious diseases and professor at the University of Turku, says that THL's figure of some 1900 incidents of Lyme disease last year [2015] only reflects cases where diagnoses were reached through blood tests. When patients have the telltale ring-shaped skin rash that marks the onset of the illness, physicians usually just skip the blood test. """"And in most cases, that's what happens,"""" Oksi says.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The doctor makes a diagnosis of Lyme disease and prescribes the patient antibiotics. Additionally, when the malady is still its early stages, sometimes a blood test cannot confirm Lyme, he says. """"This means we should take THL's figures and multiply them by 4,"""" Oksi estimates.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Jussi Sane, an epidemiologist at THL agrees with Oksi's assessment that the agency's statistics don't reflect the real number but says the number is likely closer to between 4 and 5000 cases. """"THL only records more advanced cases of Lyme disease, when the illness has spread throughout the body,"""" Sane says, adding that the agency is currently examining exactly how widespread Lyme disease actually is. Oksi says he thinks the increased incidents of Lyme disease in Finland is directly related to an increase in tick populations, which is caused by an increasingly milder climate.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"A colder winter this year [2016] has some people wondering whether the tick population would be diminished this summer, but Oksi says probably not. They'll be back this summer. """"This past winter won't affect them. Ticks can survive harsh winters, and this winter just hasn't been harsh enough to have had an effect,"""" he says.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There are 2 species of ticks in Finland	 the common tick and the taiga tick	 both of which can spread Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. It's thanks to research at the University of Turku that experts know there has been an increase of at least taiga tick populations in Finland. As part of a study in 2015	 people from across the country sent the university some 20 000 ticks	 and researchers learned that there were even more taiga ticks in Finland than they previously thought. Anecdotal evidence points to an increase in ticks in general	 but there are currently no official figures on how much tick populations have changed	 Oksi says.;;;;;;;;;;

[_Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato is a group of genetically and phenotypically distinct spirochetal bacterial species	 not all of which are known to cause human disease (<http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/633.long>). _Borrelia_ species are differentially distributed worldwide. In Europe	 most commonly _B. garinii_	 and _B. afzelii_ cause Lyme borreliosis in humans; whereas	 in North America	 _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto causes Lyme borreliosis. (A new _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato genospecies (candidatus _B. mayonii_) has been reported to occur in patients with Lyme disease in the upper Midwestern US. See ProMED-mail post Lyme disease - USA (02): (upper Midwest region) new Borrelia species 20160222.4040006.);;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Different clinical manifestations are often associated with these different genospecies. Erythema migrans (EM) and Lyme arthritis are more common in the United States than in Europe. In the U.S.	 as many as 80-90 percent of patients with Lyme disease develop the characteristic EM rash (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs_symptoms/index.html>). Whereas neuroborreliosis [or Lyme affecting the nervous system]	 borrelial lymphocytoma [bluish-red nodular swelling]	 and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans occur more frequently in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Genetic differences between species within the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex may result in problems with the serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis	 especially in regards to immunoblot assays	 although it may be less important for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (<http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/169/2/313.abstract?ijkey=575b92fb19da9611b73c374a6947577b14843bee&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha>). However	 ELISAs using the C6 peptide are reported to overcome these problems (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/3/333.long>).;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
However	 laboratory testing is not indicated for the diagnosis of EM	 because EM is an early manifestation of Lyme disease	 which usually begins one to 2 weeks after a tick bite	 often before serologic tests become positive. Clinical findings are sufficient for the diagnosis of erythema migrans (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full>). Laboratory-based reporting will fail to capture EM	 and when clinicians fail to report EM	 Lyme disease will be underreported	 the extent of which will depend on the frequency of EM in the spectrum of clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in that region of the world.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In North America	 Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of the hard-bodied tick species _Ixodes scapularis_ and _Ixodes pacificus_. In Europe	 the vectors are _Ixodes ricinus_ and the taiga tick (_Ixodes persulcatus_). - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;;;

US researchers say they have discovered a new bacterial species that causes Lyme disease in humans [1	2].;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	 working with the Mayo Clinic [in Rochester	 Minnesota] and health officials from Minnesota	 Wisconsin	 and North Dakota	 discovered the new species	 called _Borrelia mayonii_	 the CDC said in a statement.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Previously, only _Borrelia burgdorferi_ was believed to cause human Lyme disease, which is transmitted through bites from by the blacklegged """"deer"""" tick [_Ixodes scapularis_], the CDC said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
_B. mayonii_ has so far only been detected in the upper Midwest region of the United States	 the CDC said.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Researchers discovered _B. mayonii_ after studying blood samples of patients in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota who were suspected of having Lyme disease from 2012-2014, the CDC said. Samples from 6 out of 9000 patients showed """"unusual results"""" and prompted further study, the health agency said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
_B. mayonii_ is similar to _B. burgdorferi_ in that it initially causes fever	 headache	 rash	 and neck pain and later arthritis associated with Lyme disease	 according to the CDC. But _B. mayonii_ adds nausea	 vomiting	 and widespread rash	 and causes a higher concentration of bacteria in the blood	 the CDC said.;;;;;;;;;;																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There are an estimated 300 000 cases of Lyme disease in the US annually	 according to the CDC. The disease is rarely fatal	 and most patients recover after a few weeks of oral antibiotics	 the agency said.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The patients infected with _B. mayonii_ were treated successfully with the same antibiotics used for those with _B. burgdorferi_, the CDC said. It is too early to say whether _B. mayonii_ will be more or less dangerous than _B. burgdorferi_, said Jeannine Petersen, a CDC microbiologist. """"We have fairly limited information in that our study described 6 patients,"""" she told Reuters. """"We need more patients in order to capture the full spectrum of those who might have less severe symptoms and those who might have more severe ones."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"It is likely that the bacterium is a """"recently emerged"""" organism since it did not appear in previous, extensive testing of blood samples of patients suspected of having Lyme disease, Peterson added.;;;;;;;;;;"

[_Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato (that is	 in the broad sense) is a group of genetically and phenotypically divergent spirochetal bacterial species	 not all of which are known to cause human disease (<http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/633.long>). Human infection	 called Lyme borreliosis	 due to _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato may involve multiple organs or tissues	 resulting in skin	 cardiac	 neurological	 and musculoskeletal disorders. Different _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato species have been associated with distinct clinical manifestations. Multiple erythema migrans (EM) and Lyme arthritis are more common in the United States than in Europe	 whereas neuroborreliosis [or Lyme affecting the nervous system]	 borrelial lymphocytoma [bluish-red nodular swelling]	 and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans [condition affecting distal parts of the limbs; the most common manifestation of the late stage of Lyme disease] have more frequently occurred in European patients. In addition	 _Borrelia_ species are differentially distributed worldwide. In Europe	 most commonly _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto	 _B. garinii_	 and _B. afzelii_ cause Lyme borreliosis in humans; whereas	 in the North America	 only _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto was known to cause Lyme borreliosis.;;;;;;;;

The news report above describes the finding of a new _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato genospecies (candidatus _B. mayonii_) in 6 (5 blood	 1 synovial fluid) of 100 545 clinical specimens that were submitted by physicians for routine PCR from 1 Jan 2003 to 30 Sep 2014 in the upper Midwestern USA. This organism was also detected in _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks collected at probable patient exposure sites	 but was not detected in clinical specimens before 2012.;;;;;;;;;;

However	 ELISAs using the C6 peptide are reported to overcome these problems (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/3/333.long>).

Background;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
-----------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme borreliosis is the most common tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere. It is a multisystem disease caused by _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato genospecies and characterised by tissue localisation and low spirochaetaemia. In this study	 we aimed to describe a novel _Borrelia_ species causing Lyme borreliosis in the USA.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Methods;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
--------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
At the Mayo clinic	 from 2003 to 2014	 we tested routine clinical diagnostic specimens from patients in the USA with PCR targeting the oppA1 gene of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato. We identified positive specimens with an atypical PCR result (melting temperature outside of the expected range) by sequencing	 microscopy	 or culture. We collected _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks from regions of suspected patient tick exposure and tested them by oppA1 PCR.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Findings;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
---------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
100 545 specimens were submitted by physicians for routine PCR from [1 Jan 2003] to [30 Sep 2014]. From these samples	 6 clinical specimens (5 blood	 1 synovial fluid) yielded an atypical oppA1 PCR product	 but no atypical results were detected before 2012. 5 of the 6 patients with atypical PCR results had presented with fever	 4 had diffuse or focal rash	 3 had symptoms suggestive of neurological inclusion	 and 2 were admitted to hospital. The 6th patient presented with knee pain and swelling. Motile spirochaetes were seen in blood samples from 1 patient and cultured from blood samples from 2 patients. Among the 5 blood specimens	 the median oppA1 copy number was 180 times higher than that in 13 specimens that tested positive for _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto during the same time period. Multigene sequencing identified the spirochaete as a novel _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato genospecies. This same genospecies was detected in ticks collected at a probable patient exposure site.;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We describe a new pathogenic _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato genospecies (candidatus _B. mayonii_) in the upper Midwestern USA, which causes Lyme borreliosis with unusually high spirochaetaemia.

Lyme disease cases are on the rise in Ohio	 and this year [2015?]	 Franklin County residents bore the brunt of the bites. The number of people with the disease	 spread by ticks	 has steadily increased in the past 6 years	 according to data from the Ohio Department of Health. From January through September 2015	 146 cases of Lyme disease were reported to the state agency [this number of cases is likely the Ohio State total	 but are these confirmed or probable cases?]. In all of 2014	 119 cases were reported [according to the CDC	 94 were confirmed and 25 were probable cases (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/tables.html>). 10 years ago	 58 cases were reported [the 58 were all confirmed cases (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/tables.html>).;;;;;;;;;;															
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Cases are reported by county	 based on where the infected person lives. Franklin County had 17 cases of Lyme disease [are these confirmed or probable cases?] in the 1st 3 quarters of 2015	 more than any other county.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Glen Needham, a professor emeritus of entomology at Ohio State University, said the number of cases has escalated for a few likely reasons. It's possible that people are better educated about ticks and Lyme disease. He said that could mean more people are coming forward when they start showing signs of infection. At the same time, however, Ohio's tick population also is rising, Needham said. """"We actually have ticks in places that we never had them before,"""" he said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Worse	 more ticks seem to be carrying the disease. The Medical Entomology Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base studies ticks in Ohio and has found that about 29 percent of ticks collected in Ashtabula and Coshocton counties in 2014 and part of 2015 carried Lyme disease. Similar studies conducted in 2009 and 2010 showed about 10 percent of ticks in the same areas carried the disease.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Ohio used to be home mostly to American dog ticks	 which are slightly larger than other ticks found in Ohio and don't carry Lyme disease. American dog ticks carry Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other toxins that can cause temporary paralysis in both humans and dogs.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Black-legged ticks [_Ixodes scapularis_]	 commonly called deer ticks	 are the only carrier of Lyme disease in the Midwest	 according to Ohio State University. And over the past few decades	 the number of black-legged ticks has grown -- and especially in the past 5 years.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Ohio Department of Health's numbers show those ticks now live in 67 of Ohio's 88 counties	 mostly in forests. They're much smaller than American dog ticks	 which make them more difficult to spot.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
To avoid ticks	 Needham said	 tuck your pants into socks and shirts into pants before heading into the woods. Treat clothing with permethrin	 a synthetic chemical that deters ticks. And put all your clothing into water or a washing machine when you get home. He said you should check yourself and hiking or hunting partners for ticks after you leave the forest. Pets should be kept on tick-prevention medication year-round. ;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The size of the ticks, he said, makes them difficult to find. """"I think in Ohio we're calibrated to look for dog tick-size ticks and these black-legged ticks are much, much smaller,"""" Needham said. """"You could easily pass over a tick thinking it's a mole or just a piece of debris."""";;;;;;;;;;"

[The number of confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported in Ohio was 58 in 2005 and was below that level until it rose to 74 in 2013 and then rose again to 94 in 2014 (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/tables.html>). The increased incidence of Lyme disease in Ohio could be due to a true increase in the number of cases as the primary tick vector (_Ixodes scapularis_) and the reservoir hosts of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ spread into previously uninvolved regions of the state and growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas	 but also could be due in part to better recognition and reporting in some counties.;;;;;;;;;;

The province announced Friday [25 Sep 2015] the geographic range of blacklegged ticks continues to expand north and west in Manitoba. According to the annual blacklegged ticks surveillance program	 the risk of tick-borne disease transmission is greatest in these areas. Diseases include anaplasmosis	 babesiosis and Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Blacklegged ticks found within the risk areas are more likely to carry the agents that cause the diseases. While these same ticks can be found outside of these areas	 the risk of transmission is lower.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The province said to date	 11 confirmed and probable cases of Lyme disease have been reported in 2015. Since 2009	 a total of 67 cases have been confirmed in Manitoba. ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In Lyme disease risk areas and elsewhere	 blacklegged ticks are most commonly found within and along the edge of forests and in areas with thick	 woody shrubs and other vegetation. Manitobans are encouraged to take precautions to minimize their risk of tick exposure by:;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;

[In prior ProMED-mail posts of tick-borne diseases in the US state of Maine this year	 the number of the Lyme disease cases in this state were said to be down significantly so far this year [2014]; more than 1377 cases of Lyme disease were reported in 2013	 compared to close to 1000 cases in the 1st 9 months of 2014 (ProMED-mail post Anaplasmosis - USA (02): (ME) increased incidence	 update 20141013.2857236).

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The increased incidence of anaplasmosis and babesiosis in Maine can be due to a true increase in the number of cases as the primary tick vector (_Ixodes scapularis_) and the reservoir hosts spread geographically into previously uninvolved regions; but also better recognition and reporting of anaplasmosis and babesiosis may contribute to their increases in cases	 which may explain their increased incidence despite lower numbers of Lyme disease cases. - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;;

Following a report nearly 2 months ago concerning the detection of _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 the causative agent of Lyme disease being present in blacklegged (deer) ticks in all 67 counties of Pennsylvania	 Pennsylvania health authorities reported last week that the number of Lyme disease cases increased by 25 percent from 2013 to 2014	 according to newly released data. In 2014	 the Department of Health recorded 7400 cases of Lyme disease in the commonwealth	 compared with 5900 cases in 2013.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The increase in cases can be attributed in part to heightened awareness about Lyme disease	 better reporting	 and enhanced monitoring efforts	 particularly in Allegheny County. In fact	 enhanced surveillance in Allegheny County saw an increase from 32 cases in 2013 to a whopping 822 cases seen in 2014. In addition to Allegheny County	 Butler County reported 412 and Montgomery County saw 384 Lyme disease cases.;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lyme disease is present in every county in Pennsylvania,"""" said Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Dr. Karen Murphy, speaking at a press conference with Allegheny County Health Department Director Dr. Karen Hacker in Pittsburgh. """"The prevalence of this illness serves as a reminder for people to better protect themselves from tick bites and to know the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease. For those with the disease it is important to seek early treatment to avoid any potential long-term health complications."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In 2013	 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released estimates of 300 000 Americans diagnosed annually.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is an illness transmitted through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick (deer tick). Symptoms include fever	 fatigue	 headache	 muscle aches and joint pain. A common early symptom is a red rash that looks like a bulls-eye. Ticks can be found everywhere	 but individuals should be especially cautious in areas with dense bushes or tall grass. When outdoors	 use repellents with diethyltoluamide (DEET) and protective clothing. After outdoor activities	 check for ticks	 and	 if one is found	 promptly remove it using fine-tipped tweezers and applying even pressure on the tick as it is being removed.;;;;;;;;;;

[The CDC changed the case definition of Lyme disease in 2011 to enhance case detection	 but despite a steady increase in the number of Lyme disease cases reported in most of the state of Pennsylvania from 3379 cases in 2011 to 6331 cases in 2014	 a steady decrease in number of reported cases of Lyme disease occurred in Philadelphia and its suburban counties (Bucks	 Chester	 Delaware	 Montgomery	 and Philadelphia Counties) in the southeastern part of the state from 1983 cases in 2011 to 1156 cases last year (2014) (<http://www.philly.com/philly/infographics/Graphic_Lyme_disease_in_Pa.html?c=r>).;;;;;;;;;;

"A spreadsheet showing the number of cases by county from 1992 to 2014 is also available at this website.

The increased incidence of Lyme disease in Allegheny county could be due to a true increase in the number of cases as the primary tick vector (_Ixodes scapularis_) and the reservoir hosts of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ spread westerly into previously uninvolved regions and growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas	 but also better recognition and reporting in some counties may contribute to their increases in cases.;;;;;;;;;;

Pascal Mespouille, a doctor who specializes in neuropsychiatry at the San Jose hospital in Arlon, explained the reasons of this increase: """"Climate plays a role in the proliferation of the ticks. Before, they were mainly found in the south of France, but now the ticks are all over Europe. The population of our province is at risk due to the many fields and forests in our region."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lyme disease is transmitted by tick bites. However, not all wounds are synonymous with Lyme disease. Only the ticks that carry the _Borrelia_ bacteria can transmit the Lyme borreliosis. """"In the hospital in Arlon, patients come to have the ticks removed but also to get treated for the disease transmitted by the ticks. If it is detected early, a simple treatment with antibiotics will stop the disease,"""" explained Dr Mespouille. However, some people do not notice a bite immediately. """"If untreated, the disease progresses in several stages. Every year, the hospital in Arlon treats between 30 and 40 cases of stage 3 Lyme disease (the most serious). It is an intense intervention, which requires intravenous treatment over 3 weeks. But the hospital in Arlon is well equipped to detect, treat and cure this type of infection,"""" said the doctor who specializes in neuropsychiatry.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The Hydrion Arlon sports center is also concerned by these blood-sucking parasites. The many outdoor activities are a godsend for the ticks in search of blood. """"We are counting on prevention: we recommend the parents to thoroughly check their children when they return home. When a child gets bitten, I remove the tick immediately and I disinfect the wound"""", explained Nicolas Kergen, a Hydrion camp counselor.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The first aid kit at the sports complex allows treatment of tick bites very quickly but not to prevent them: """"We have tweezers and antiseptic. Unfortunately, there are only 2 bottles of insect repellent that are reserved for the counselors. If we had to spray all the campers and interns, we would never get by as there are so many,"""" commented the sensitive sports monitor faced with this problem. He added: """"We never had any case of infected children. On the other hand, counselors are also at risk;"" 2 of my colleagues were bitten and contracted Lyme disease. I was bitten by 2 ticks"	" but I got lucky and was not infected."""""""""";;;;;;;;;"																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Benedicte Jadot, director of the after school programs in Arlon, is also worried about the ugly bugs. Following the example of Hydrion, emphasis is put on prevention. """"We ask the parents to pay close attention and to check their child. This summer, we recorded only one single bite on a child. We immediately removed the tick with special tweezers and disinfected the wound. The child did not contract the disease."""";;;;;;;;;;"

[Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere	 occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America	 Europe and Asia. It is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete	 _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex	 a genetically diverse group of spirochetes (<http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/42/3/378.full.pdf>). Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks	 and various small- and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts. ;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The species of tick	 the host species	 borrelial genospecies and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. The patterns of disease also differ by geographical location. For example	 acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and neuroborreliosis are more common in Europe	 whereas arthritis appears to be prevalent in the United States.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
At least 3 species of the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex (_B. afzelii_	 _B. garinii_	 and _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto) are known to cause Lyme disease in humans	 although _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the only pathogenic species to cause Lyme disease in North America. It also occurs in Europe	 but is less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_	 the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Individual ticks can be infected with more than one genospecies of _B. burgdorferi sensu lato_ complex. In Europe	 _B. burgdorferi_ genospecies that cause Lyme borreliosis are mainly transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. In a literature review of studies of the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato in _I. ricinus_ ticks in various European countries	 the overall mean prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_-infected ticks was 13.7 percent (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/>). For Belgium	 the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_-infected ticks was 23 percent; _B. garinii_ was most prevalent (53 percent of infected ticks)	 followed by _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto (38 percent) and _B. afzelii_ (9 percent). Of the infected ticks	 40 percent were infected with a single species	 40 percent were infected with 2 species	 and 5 percent were infected with all 3 species (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC105328/>). ;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Belgium is divided into 3 regions	 Brussels	 Flanders and Wallonia; the latter 2 regions are divided in turn into provinces (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Belgium>). Arlon	 with a population of 275 594 in 2013	 is capital city of the Walloon province of Luxembourg. - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;;

The chief sanitary epidemiology doctor of Kaliningrad	 E. Babura	 reported that tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease were still highly prevalent in 2014. ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There were 11 cases of tick-borne encephalitis registered in 2014; the incidence rate was 1.15 per 100 000 population. The disease has been registered in 6 regions of Kaliningrad (2 in the city	 1 in Svetlovsky and 5 in Nesterov districts	 1 in Nemansk	 1 in Slavsk	 and 1 in Gusev districts).;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The incidence of Lyme disease is also high with 137 cases; the incidence rate was 14.35 per 100 000 population	 which is higher than the national Russian average.;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In 2014	 2520 people reported tick bites in Kaliningrad (in 2013  - 2523)	 and in 26 percent of cases these are children under 14 years of age (665 cases).;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Tick encephalitis antigen was discovered in 1.5 percent of ticks removed from affected people (in 2013. - 1.1 percent)	 and antigen to borreliosis was found in 13 percent (in 2013 - 18 percent).;;;;;;;;;;

[The Kaliningrad Department of Sanitary Surveillance stated that the level of acaricidal treatment is still low in some of the districts. In addition	 the population is inadequately covered by vaccination. Every year only 5000 people are vaccinated or revaccinated	 which does not guarantee protection at the population level. All these deficits cause high incidence of tick-borne infections. - ProMED Corr.BA ;;;;;;;;;;

Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) is caused by the TBE virus	 an RNA virus that belongs to the genus Flavivirus and is closely related to Powassan virus. TBEV has 3 subtypes: European	 Siberian	 and Far Eastern. TBEV is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick of the _Ixodes_ species	 primarily _I. ricinus_ (in Europe) or _I. persulcatus_ (in Siberia and Far Eastern Russia). Ticks are both vector and virus reservoir	 and small rodents are the primary amplifying host. TBE can also be acquired by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products (e.g.	 milk and cheese) from infected goats	 sheep	 or cows. TBEV transmission has been infrequently reported during laboratory exposure and slaughtering viremic animals	 and direct person-to-person transmission	 through blood transfusion and breastfeeding.;;;;;;;;;;															
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Russia	 especially western Siberia	 has the largest number of reported TBE cases. Other European countries with known endemic areas include Austria	 Croatia	 Czech Republic	 Denmark	 Estonia	 Finland	 France	 Germany	 Hungary	 Italy	 Latvia	 Lithuania	 Norway	 Poland	 Romania	 Slovakia	 Slovenia	 Sweden	 and Switzerland. Asian countries with reported TBE cases or virus activity include China	 Japan	 Kazakhstan	 Kyrgyzstan	 Mongolia	 and South Korea.;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The risk of acquiring TBE in forested areas through activities such as camping	 hiking	 fishing	 bicycling	 or military training peaks in early and late summer when ticks are active. The incidence and severity of disease are highest in people aged at least 50 years. The risk is negligible for people who remain in urban or unforested areas and who do not consume unpasteurized dairy products.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
No TBE vaccines are licensed or available in the United States	 though 2 inactivated cell culture-derived TBE vaccines are available in Europe	 in adult and pediatric formulations: FSME-IMMUN (Baxter	 Austria) and Encepur (Novartis	 Germany). The adult formulation of FSME-IMMUN is also licensed in Canada. In Russia 2 other inactivated TBE vaccines are available: TBE-Moscow (Chumakov Institute	 Russia) and EnceVir (Microgen	 Russia). At least 1 other TBE vaccine is produced in China	 but information regarding this vaccine is not available in the English literature. The European and Russian vaccines should provide cross-protection against all 3 TBEV subtypes. Vaccine failures have been reported	 particularly in people aged at least 50 years. ;;;;;;;;;;																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The routine primary TBE vaccination series is given after 6 months of age;"" the first booster dose should be given 3 years after the primary series and subsequent booster doses vary by age: every 5 years for people aged less than 50 years and every 3 years for those aged at least 50 years. An accelerated vaccination schedule has been evaluated for both European TBE vaccines"	 and results in seroconversion rates are similar to those observed with the standard vaccination schedule. Travelers anticipating high-risk exposures	 such as working or camping in forested areas or farmland	 adventure travel	 or living in TBE-endemic countries for an extended period of time	" may wish to be vaccinated in Canada or Europe."""""""""";;;;;;;;;"																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In the news report above	 the incidence of Lyme disease in the region is greater than that of TBE	 possibly on account of the availability of an effective vaccine for TBE. There is no Lyme disease vaccine for humans currently available in the US or Russia. SmithKline Beecham (now GlaxoSmithKline) withdrew the 1st and only FDA-licensed vaccine against Lyme disease in 2002 (<http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/history-lyme-disease-vaccine>). The best way to avoid getting Lyme disease is to prevent tick bites; (see <http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/prev/on_people.html>).

It would be interesting to see a posting about any work happening to reintroduce a Lyme disease vaccine given the increasing incidence and the spread of the range of the ticks and the disease in North America.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
An effective vaccine would be extremely useful given the intrusiveness of the protective measures (long pants and sleeves	 plus layers of DEET in hot weather) and would be preferable to frequent courses of antibiotics for prophylaxis or treatment. Not surprisingly	 very few religiously follow the prevention measures	 especially as they may be needed beyond areas with heavy grass and other vegetation.;;;;;;;;;;

LYMErix	 a recombinant Lyme disease vaccine containing an outer surface protein (OspA) from _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 1st licensed in 1998	 is no longer available	 and there is no other vaccine currently available to prevent Lyme disease. The vaccine manufacturer (SmithKline Beecham	 now GlaxoSmithKline) discontinued production in 2002 as a result of insufficient consumer demand	 plus public concern about adverse effects (arthritis) and class action lawsuits (See Dr. Stanley Plotkin's op-ed article in the New York Times last year (2013) at: <http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/opinion/bring-back-the-lyme-vaccine.html>).;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The concerns about OspA vaccine side effects involved a theoretically possible rare immune-mediated complication of inflammatory arthritis in people with HLA-DR4 haplotype via antibodies against _B. burgdorferi_ antigens that could cross-react with autoantigens (i.e.	 molecular mimicry) (1	2). A new	 potentially safer 2nd-generation vaccine for humans that excludes the cross-reactive epitope is being studied (3).;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In the United States	 4 veterinary vaccines are available: (1) monovalent bacterin	 available since 1990; (2) bivalent bacterin	 available since 1994; (3) nonadjuvanted rOspA vaccine	 available since 1996; and (4) adjuvanted rOspA vaccine	 available since 1999	 but their use has been debated (4).;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The recombinant OspA vaccine had an unusual mechanism of action; the OspA antigen in the vaccine stimulated circulating anti-OspA antibodies that would be ingested by the tick during a blood meal and kill _Borrelia burgdorferi_ within the tick's gut as it fed on the human host	 before the bacteria were able to enter the human body. The vaccine was indicated in individuals between 15 and 70 years old in regions with high rates of Lyme disease. The vaccine was found to be about 80 percent effective in protecting against the infection	 but 3 doses were required over a 12-month period	 so that people were not fully protected in the 1st year of vaccination; the vaccine could not be used in children younger that 15 years of age who were at high risk; there was the theoretical possibility of autoimmune inflammatory arthritis; and because the duration of protection afforded by 3 injections of vaccine was not known	 additional booster injections may have been necessary (5).;;;;;;

While the number of new confirmed cases in the US as a whole fluctuated from 21 273 in 2003 to a peak of almost 30 000 cases in 2009	 to fall to 22 561 cases in 2010	 rise the next year to 24 364 cases in 2011 and fall again to 22 014 cases in 2012	 the number of new confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported in New York State	 which fluctuated from 5399 cases in 2003 to a low of 4165 cases in 2007	 only to rise again to 5741 cases in 2008	 has indeed mostly fallen every year since 2008 to 2044 cases in 2012 (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html>). ;;;;;;;;;;

"However, Lyme disease is not evenly distributed across New York State. It is concentrated in several southern counties, such as Dutchess, Westchester, and Suffolk Counties (<http://www.cdc.gov/Lyme/stats/>), and there are likely """"hotspots"""" for Lyme disease within these counties. The incidence is likely higher than reported in the Hamptons, because this beach community in Suffolk County has a population of transient renters during the warmer summer months and diseases are reported by county of residence, rather than where the disease was actually acquired. Under-reporting is thus likely to occur in a highly endemic area of summer rentals like the Hamptons, whereas over-reporting may occur in non-endemic areas.;;;;;;;;;;"

It's the Hamptons' [Suffolk County	 Long Island	 New York] dirty little secret: dozens of children and adults are being diagnosed with Lyme disease each day as officials mount a campaign to battle ticks. The problem has gotten so bad that Southampton Hospital launched the Tick-Borne Disease Resource Center to help residents bugging out over the tiny blood-suckers.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"One physician, Dr Blake Kerr, told The Post he treats 100 patients a week for Lyme disease. """"It's an epidemic,"""" said Kerr, who runs Wainscott Walk-In Medical Center and last summer contracted Lyme and 2 other tick-borne illnesses simultaneously. Pediatrician Dr Nadia Persheff of Hampton Pediatrics in Southampton sees as many as 4 children a day for Lyme disease and 20 for tick bites -- including one 3-week-old baby who came in with 4 ticks on his back. """"You have to check every kid and every baby,"""" Persheff said. """"We're much busier than last summer. I've never seen it like this."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Suffolk County was ground zero for Lyme disease in 2012	 leading the state [New York State] with 689 reported cases	 data show. In 2013	 the number of reported cases dropped to 566	 according to state data.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Still	 locals believe the ticks -- and tick-related illnesses -- are growing every year. The culprits are often deer ticks	 which carry Lyme or malaria-like diseases such as babesiosis and -- at the size of a poppy seed -- are much smaller than common wood ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease	 a bacterial illness with symptoms of skin rash	 headache	 and fatigue can cause neurological damage and other serious problems if left untreated. Early treatment typically includes a single dose of antibiotics.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Brian Kelly, owner of East End Tick and Mosquito Control, said he has fielded frantic calls from out-of-towners who want him to remove ticks from their bodies. """"People are realizing they're everywhere -- you can't even go to the beach without getting a tick,"""" Kelly said.;;;;;;;;;;"

[In the USA	 the prevalence of _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks	 the vector of Lyme disease	 commonly ranges between 20 and 40 percent in New England	 the Mid-Atlantic States	 and Minnesota and Wisconsin	 where Lyme disease is endemic (Wormser GP	 Dattwyler RJ	 Shapiro ED	 et al: The clinical assessment	 treatment	 and prevention of Lyme disease	 human granulocytic anaplasmosis	 and babesiosis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Clin Infect Dis. (2006) 43(9): 1089-134. doi: 10.1086/508667. Available at <http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full>).;;;;;;;;;;												
;;;;;;;;;;																									
However	 at sites in Westchester and Suffolk Counties in New York State (one of the Mid-Atlantic states)	 over 50 percent prevalence of _I. scapularis_ ticks have been found to be infected with _B. burgdorferi_	 and over 20 percent of _B. burgdorferi_-infected ticks were either co-infected with _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (the cause of human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA) or _Babesia microti_ (the cause of babesiosis); a lower percentage was co-infected with _Borrelia miyamotoi_ (the cause of a relapsing-fever like illness) (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2883481/>).;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In regions where the local rate of _B. burgdorferi_ infection in _Ixodes_ ticks is at least 20 percent	 the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends chemoprophylaxis with a single dose of antibiotic after a tick bite	 if (a) the attached tick can be reliably identified as an adult or nymphal _I. scapularis_ tick that is estimated to have been attached for 36 hours or longer on the basis of the degree of engorgement of the tick with blood or of certainty about the time of exposure to the tick	 (b) prophylaxis can be started within 72 hours of the time that the tick was removed	 and (c) there is not contraindication for the antibiotic. Chemoprophylaxis can consist of a single dose of doxycycline for adults (200 mg dose) and children at least 8 years of age (4 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) after a recognized tick bite (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full>).;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Treatment of adult patients with early localized or early disseminated Lyme disease associated with erythema migrans	 in the absence of specific neurologic manifestations or advanced atrioventricular heart block	 is doxycycline (100 mg twice per day)	 amoxicillin (500 mg 3 times per day)	 or cefuroxime axetil (500 mg twice per day) for 14 days (range	 10-21 days for doxycycline and 14-21 days for amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil) (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full>). Doxycycline has the advantage of being effective for treatment of HGA (but not for babesiosis)	 which may occur simultaneously with early Lyme disease. Doxycycline is relatively contraindicated during pregnancy or lactation and in children less than 8 years of age. Antibiotics recommended for children are amoxicillin (50 mg/kg per day in 3 divided doses [maximum of 500 mg per dose])	 cefuroxime axetil (30 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses [maximum of 500 mg per dose])	 or	 if the patient is 8 years of age or older	 doxycycline (4 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses [maximum of 100 mg per dose]) (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full>).;;;;;;;;;;

If you're heading into the woods this summer [2014]	 it's time to take Lyme disease seriously. Cases of the illness continue to rise in southern Quebec; in the Monteregie alone	 cases have grown 4-fold in the last few years.;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"A St. Lazare resident knows the story well. She and her family headed out on a day trip a few weeks ago and woke up the next day with a burning a sensation on her leg. """"I kept rubbing and thinking it was a mole that was just raised and was bothering me, so I kept rubbing and rubbing,"""" said [the St. Lazare resident]. """"Then eventually, when I went to the washroom and I actually looked down, I saw little legs sticking out."""" Those legs belonged to a tick. [The St. Lazare resident's] husband pulled the tick out with a pair of tweezers, but within a few days she was developing a rash with the characteristic of Lyme disease. """"(The rash) was almost as big as my fist. It was red, and it was starting to show the bulls-eye pattern that they look for,"""" she said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Early symptoms include fever	 headache	 dizziness and the tell-tale rash. If left untreated	 symptoms can last months to years and include recurring arthritis	 nervous system and/or neurological problems	 numbness and/or paralysis. Although not common	 fatalities from Lyme disease have been reported.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Ticks are small	 ranging in size from a poppy seed to a pea	 the Public Health Agency of Canada noted. The size of the tick varies depending on its age and whether it has fed recently.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
[The St. Lazare resident] believes she picked up the tick just across the Ontario border and carried it back home to Quebec.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"1st identified in the USA, Lyme disease has been on a steady increase since it was 1st reported here [Canada] in 2006. Last year [2013], 142 cases of Lyme disease were reported in the province. Half -- 76 total -- were in the Monteregie. """"It's just the progression because of the climatic change. It's crossing the border,"""" said Dr. Alain Poirier, director of Monteregie Public Health.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Still, some Quebecers and even doctors may not be as aware of it, he said. In an effort to spread awareness, the Monteregie Health Agency has been working to share information with local health professionals. """"For doctors, we have specific tools to teach them about specific information, prevention and treatment,"""" said Poirier. The goal is for health professionals across the province to now recognize and report cases. """"There's a campaign of information going on right now so that people would be much [more] informed than they have been in the past,"""" said Dr. Richard Masse, director of Montreal Public Health.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"[The St. Lazare resident] said, however, she has heard of some people being told by their doctors not to worry about tick bites. """"They were (saying), """"No, Lyme disease doesn't exist in Quebec. Just go home,"""" she said, adding that she elected to go to a hospital in Alexandria, Ontario just across the border, where a doctor prescribed antibiotics. """"They don't take any chances,"""" said [the St. Lazare resident]. """"As soon as they see the redness, they will give you the antibiotic right away."""" [She] has felt fine since and urges others to watch for ticks and seek treatment if they're suspected of contracting the illness.;;;;;;;;;;"

[Quebec is a province in eastern Canada. Monteregie	 with a population of 1 442 433 (2011)	 is an administrative region in southern Quebec. It is located mostly along the southern shore of the St. Lawrence River	 between the city of Montreal and the New York State border (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monteregie>). The city of St. Lazare	 where the _B. burgdorferi_-infected patient mentioned in the news article above resided	 is a suburb west of Montreal	 located in the portion of Monteregie that borders Ontario	 north of the St. Lawrence River. Saint-Lazare has experienced rapid growth since 1990 (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Lazare	_Quebec>). Monteregie can be found on a map of the subdivisions of Quebec at: <http://www.quebec511.info/en/carte_routiere/>.;;;;;;;;;;																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In the USA	 the prevalence of _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks commonly ranges between 20 and 40 percent in New England	 the Mid-Atlantic States	 and Minnesota and Wisconsin	 where Lyme disease is endemic (Wormser GP	 Dattwyler RJ	 Shapiro ED	 et al: The clinical assessment	 treatment	 and prevention of Lyme disease	 human granulocytic anaplasmosis	 and babesiosis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Clin Infect Dis. (2006) 43 (9): 1089-1134. doi: 10.1086/508667. Available at <http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full>). Prevalence of infected ticks has been found to be almost 30 to over 50 percent in southern counties of New York State (<http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0099348#pone-0099348-g001> and <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2883481/>).;;;;;;;;;;														
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends in regions where the local rate of _B. burgdorferi_ infection in _Ixodes_ ticks is at least 20 percent that antibiotic prophylaxis be given for prevention of Lyme disease after a recognized tick bite	 if (a) the attached tick can be reliably identified as an adult or nymphal _I. scapularis_ tick that is estimated to have been attached for 36 hours or longer on the basis of the degree of engorgement of the tick with blood or of certainty about the time of exposure to the tick	 (b) prophylaxis can be started within 72 hours of the time that the tick was removed	 and (c) there is not contraindication for the antibiotic. A single dose of doxycycline is recommended for adults (200 mg dose) and children at least 8 years of age (4 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 200 mg).;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The prevalence of infected ticks in St. Lazare	 Monteregie is not mentioned in the news report above	 but the prevalence of infected ticks in southern Ontario just west of the head of the St Lawrence River	 about 350 km (217 miles) southwest of St Lazare	 was reported in a recent ProMED-mail post (Lyme disease - Canada (02): (ON) _B. burgdorferi_ prevalence in ticks 20140509.2461398) to have risen to 15 percent in 2013	 just below the 20 percent threshold. In any case	 the St. Lazare resident said she believes she picked up the tick just across the border in Ontario.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Factors that could account for a true increase in disease incidence include climate change	 growth of suburban neighborhoods like St. Lazare into surrounding wooded areas	 and enlarging populations of deer	 white-footed mice and other small rodents	 and _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_. Deer	 although not susceptible to Lyme disease	 supply the adult tick with a required blood meal; white-footed mice and other small rodents are the primary reservoirs for the Lyme disease bacillus; and nymphal _I. scapularis_ are the primary tick vectors for Lyme disease in the northeastern US and southeastern Canada. - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;

Cases of the newly emerging illnesses anaplasmosis and babesiosis continue to rise	 while a recently discovered disease also transmitted by the bite of a deer tick [_Ixodes scapularis_] -- [relapsing fever-like illness due to] _Borrelia miyamotoi_ -- has been detected in more than a dozen Cape Codders.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Dr. Laurel Miller, medical director of infectious disease services for Cape Cod Healthcare, said a Norwood laboratory that has developed a test for [_B.] miyamotoi_ has diagnosed 13 -14 people from the Cape with the tick-borne illness this summer [2014]. """"We're starting to see miyamotoi. It's not huge numbers,"""" Miller said. The disease was 1st documented in U.S. residents in early 2013.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
An equal number of anaplasmosis cases also has been detected in Cape patients this summer [2014]	 she said. Lyme cases continue to outnumber other tick-borne diseases	 Miller said. A couple of weeks ago	 Cape Cod Hospital admitted 5 people with Lyme disease	 babesiosis and a combination of both illnesses	 she said.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Anaplasmosis and babesiosis can both be deadly	 especially in elderly people or people with compromised immune systems. In rare cases	 Lyme has been known to cause fatal heart problems. Cape Cod Healthcare officials said a patient who died at Cape Cod Hospital this summer [2014] was infected with anaplasmosis	 but the illness was not the cause of death.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Though fewer in number than Lyme disease cases, the number of anaplasmosis and babesiosis diagnoses have almost quadrupled over the past 5 years in Massachusetts, said Dr. Catherine Brown, state public health veterinarian. """"We know there's a lot of tick-borne illness in Massachusetts,"""" she said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In 2013	 the most recent year for which the state Department of Public Health has numbers	 there were 151 cases of babesiosis on the Cape and Islands and 37 cases of anaplasmosis. There were also 387 confirmed or probable cases of Lyme disease in Barnstable	 Dukes and Nantucket counties	 which came to more than 5 percent of the total number in the state	 5665.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Cape and Islands region is ground zero for babesiosis	 with the highest incidence rate in the state	 and it's 2nd only to Berkshire County for the incidence of anaplasmosis.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Nancy Ross of Hyannis knows the likelihood of getting tick-borne disease is higher on the Cape than other parts of the state, so she usually wears long pants when working in her garden. A few weeks ago -- on one of the few hot days of this summer [2014] -- she wore shorts to trim the shrubs and ended up finding a tick and what looked like five bites on her ankles and knees. Ross rapidly developed hot red rashes and a host of symptoms including a painful eye, shortness of breath, high blood pressure, a sore left arm and swollen knee. Her doctor immediately put her on doxycycline, which cleared up the symptoms, Ross said. """"He thought it was tick-related"""" and plans to test her this week to see which pathogen carried by the deer tick most likely made her ill, she said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease	 anaplasmosis and miyamotoi all respond to doxycycline	 but babesiosis	 which has been likened to a malarial-type illness	 requires another type of treatment.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dr. Timothy Biliouris of Cape Cod Medical Center in South Dennis said in an email that while Lyme disease is still the most prevalent tick-borne illness presented by his patients	 cases of babesiosis are growing at a faster pace. Last summer [2013]	 there were 8 cases of suspected	 probable and confirmed babesiosis in Barnstable	 Barnstable Town Health Agent Thomas McKean said. During the same time period this year [1 Jun-22 Aug 2014]	 there have been 12 cases.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Anaplasmosis cases also are on the rise in Barnstable. Last summer [2013]	 there was one case	 and this summer	 there have been 4 confirmed	 4 suspected	 and one probable case	 McKean said. He said the town public health nurse will review lab reports and talk to physicians and patients about the probable and suspected cases before deciding whether to report them to the state DPH.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"At Cape Cod Healthcare, doctors -- including emergency department physicians -- are being advised to test for all 4 known diseases carried by deer ticks -- Lyme, babesiosis, anaplasmosis and miyamotoi -- this summer [2014], Miller said. She said the miyamotoi test is new. """"There's more awareness,"""" Miller said. """"There's more testing going on."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Although miyamotoi has not been known to be fatal in the U.S.	 health officials are eager to keep tabs on the newly identified illness.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Larry Dapsis, deer tick program coordinator and entomologist with the Cape Cod Cooperative Extension, said the organization received USD 20 000 in funding to have researchers examine the DNA of 400 ticks from the Cape and Islands on file at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for miyamotoi. """"It's probably been here for a while,"""" Dapsis said. """"But we haven't looked for it."""" UMass microbiologist Stephen Rich should have the results in a couple of weeks, Dapsis said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The snowy winter and relatively rainy summer weather might have played a role in tick cases by keeping ticks, which dry up in low humidity, alive, Dapsis said. """"Anything that can help maintain high humidity is beneficial to ticks,"""" he said. """"Typically, things dry out and get really hot in July,"""" said Sam R. Telford III, infectious disease expert and professor at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University. The dry weather kills the ticks in their nymphal stage, a point in which they are particularly dangerous because their tiny poppy-seed size makes them hard to spot. But """"we have had very cool and wet weather in July [2014], so the nymphs have persisted longer than they usually do,"""" Telford wrote in an email. He said this could translate into more reports of Lyme disease later into the summer season than usual.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The adult ticks emerging now are easier to see but more likely to carry Lyme disease than the nymphs, said Brenda Boleyn, co-chairwoman of the Barnstable County Lyme/Tick-borne Diseases Task Force. """"Be careful with your tick checks,"""" she said. Consider using DEET-based repellents on bare skin and permethrin-based repellents on clothing, Brown said. She suggested wearing light clothing outdoors so the ticks stand out.;;;;;;;;;;"

Abstract;;;;;;;;;;																									
--------;;;;;;;;;;																									
Humans in the northeastern and midwestern United States are at increasing risk of acquiring tickborne diseases -- not only Lyme disease	 but 2 two emerging diseases	 human granulocytic anaplasmosis and human babesiosis. Co-infection with 2 or more of these pathogens can increase the severity of health impacts. The risk of co-infection is intensified by the ecology of these 3 diseases because all 3 pathogens (_Borrelia burgdorferi_	 _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_	 and _Babesia microti_) are transmitted by the same vector	 blacklegged ticks (_Ixodes scapularis_)	 and are carried by many of the same reservoir hosts. The risk of exposure to multiple pathogens from a single tick bite and the sources of co-infected ticks are not well understood. In this study	 we quantify the risk of co-infection by measuring infection prevalence in 4368 questing nymphs throughout an endemic region for all 3 diseases (Dutchess County	 NY) to determine if co-infections occur at frequencies other than predicted by independent assortment of pathogens. Further	 we identify sources of co-infection by quantifying rates of co-infection on 3275 larval ticks fed on known hosts. We find significant deviations of levels of co-infection in questing nymphs	 most notably 83 percent more co-infection with _Babesia microti_ and _Borrelia burgdorferi_ than predicted by chance alone. Further	 this pattern of increased co-infection was observed in larval ticks that fed on small mammal hosts [Northern short-tailed shrews	 white-footed mice	 masked shrews	 and eastern chipmunks]	 but not on meso-mammal [Virginia opossums and raccoons]	 sciurid [Southern flying squirrels	 Eastern gray squirrels	 and North American red squirrels]	 or avian hosts [veeries	 gray catbirds	 wood thrushes	 and American robins]. Co-infections involving _A. phagocytophilum_ were less common	 and fewer co-infections of _A. phagocytophilum_ and _B. microti_ than predicted by chance were observed in both questing nymphs and larvae fed on small mammals. Medical practitioners should be aware of the elevated risk of _B. microti_/_B. burgdorferi_ co-infection.;;;;;;;;;;		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In the USA	 the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ infection in _I. scapularis_ ticks commonly ranges between 20 percent and 40 percent in New England	 the Mid-Atlantic States	 and Minnesota and Wisconsin	 where Lyme disease is endemic (Wormser GP	 Dattwyler RJ	 Shapiro ED	 et al: The clinical assessment	 treatment	 and prevention of Lyme disease	 human granulocytic anaplasmosis	 and babesiosis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Clin Infect Dis. 2006; 43(9): 1089-134. doi: 10.1086/508667; available at <http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full>). In addition	 _I. scapularis_ can be infected with _A. phagocytophilum_	 _B. microti_	 and _Rickettsia_ spp.;;;;;;;;											
;;;;;;;;;;																									
This topic has also been reviewed in an article by EA Belongia (Epidemiology and impact of coinfections acquired from _Ixodes_ ticks. Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2002 Winter; 2(4): 265-73; abstract available at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12804168>); the abstract is extracted below:;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Coinfections occur with varying frequency in ticks. The proportion of _I. scapularis_ or _I. ricinus_ ticks coinfected with both _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato and _Anaplasma phagocytophila_ is generally low	 ranging from less than 1 percent to 6 percent in 6 geographic areas. A higher prevalence of tick coinfection (26 percent) has been reported in Westchester County	 New York. The proportion of _Ixodes_ ticks coinfected with _B. burgdorferi_ and _Babesia microti_ has ranged from 2 percent in New Jersey to 19 percent on Nantucket Island	 Massachusetts.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Several studies have prospectively assessed the occurrence of acute coinfection. Among patients with a confirmed tickborne infection	 coinfection rates as high as 39 percent have been reported. The most commonly recognized coinfection in most of the eastern United States is Lyme borreliosis (LB) and babesiosis	 accounting for approximately 80 percent of coinfections. LB and human granulocytic anaplasmosis coinfections are less common	 occurring in 3-15 percent of patients with a tickborne infection in Connecticut or Wisconsin. Studies of clinical outcomes suggest that patients with acute _Babesia_ coinfection have more severe symptoms and a longer duration of illness than patients with LB alone	 but the risk of spirochete dissemination is similar. - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;;;

[Prince Edward County	 with a population 25 258 in 2011	 is located in Southern Ontario on a large irregular headland at the northeastern end of Lake Ontario	 just west of the head of the St Lawrence River (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_County	_Ontario>). Because the Murray Canal transects the only land connection	 the county is technically an island. The county's relatively mild climate due to the influence of Lake Ontario has led to the establishment of many vineyards and wineries (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_County	_Ontario>). For a map of prince Edward County	 see <https://www.google.com/maps/@44.0065784	-77.2052547	8z>.;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Chances of acquiring Lyme disease in Canada are quite low	 except in areas where the eastern and western blacklegged tick populations are firmly established. The eastern blacklegged ticks (_Ixodes scapularis_) are well established in Canada in some locations in Ontario along the shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario	 in southeastern Manitoba	 and in Bedford and the Lunenburg area of Nova Scotia (<http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/ID/LymeDisease.htm>).;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In the USA	 the prevalence of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ infection in _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks commonly ranges between 20 percent and 40 percent in New England	 the Mid-Atlantic States	 and Minnesota and Wisconsin	 where Lyme disease is endemic (Wormser GP	 Dattwyler RJ	 Shapiro ED	 et al: The clinical assessment	 treatment	 and prevention of Lyme disease	 human granulocytic anaplasmosis	 and babesiosis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Clin Infect Dis. (2006) 43 (9): 1089-1134. doi: 10.1086/508667. Available at <http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full>).;;;;;;;;;;														
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In regions where the local rate of _B. burgdorferi_ infection of _Ixodes_ ticks is at least 20 percent	 antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for prevention of Lyme disease after a recognized tick bite	 if (a) the attached tick can be reliably identified as an adult or nymphal _I. scapularis_ tick that is estimated to have been attached for 36 hours or longer on the basis of the degree of engorgement of the tick with blood or of certainty about the time of exposure to the tick	 (b) prophylaxis can be started within 72 hours of the time that the tick was removed	 and (c) there is not contraindication for the antibiotic. A single dose of doxycycline is recommended for adults (200 mg dose) and children at least 8 years of age (4 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 200 mg).;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The time limit of 72 hours is suggested because of the absence of data on the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis for tick bites following tick removal after longer time intervals. Whether use of antibiotic prophylaxis after a tick bite will reduce the incidence of human granulocytic anaplasmosis or babesiosis, diseases also transmitted by _Ixodes_, is unknown. Doxycycline is relatively contraindicated in pregnant women and children under 8 years of age, but the IDSA panel did not believe that amoxicillin should be substituted for doxycycline in these people because of """"the absence of data on an effective short-course regimen for prophylaxis, the likely need for a multiday regimen (and its associated adverse effects), the excellent efficacy of antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease if infection were to develop, and the extremely low risk that a person with a recognized bite will develop a serious complication of Lyme disease"""" (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full>). - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;;;"

Confirmed and probable cases of Lyme disease in Nova Scotia nearly tripled in 2013 over the previous year. The dramatic hike in numbers was not unexpected	 said provincial Health and Wellness Department officials. The number of cases	 including probable ones	 in 2013 was 155	 department spokesman Tony Kiritsis said recently. In 2012	 the number of cases was 52	 and in 2011	 it was 57.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"There could be a lot of factors, but we do know that there's been a lot more interest in Lyme, a lot more education out there,"""" Kiritsis said. Since 2002, the number of Lyme disease cases in this province has totalled 329. Dee Mombourquette, communicable diseases coordinator with the Health and Wellness Department, also said her department expected the increase. """"We know that people are much more aware of Lyme disease now. More (people) every year."""" People recognize symptoms and seek health-care advice sooner, she said. The 1st Lyme Disease Awareness Month began [1 May 2014] in Nova Scotia.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Climate studies have shown that Nova Scotia's environment is suitable for tick establishment across the entire province. """"We've seen that ticks have arrived, and they like it here,"""" Mombourquette said. """"The climate is certainly conducive to them increasing in numbers."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Six endemic areas listed by the department include Yarmouth, Shelburne, Queens, Lunenburg, Halifax, and Pictou counties. The Queens County zone was proclaimed in 2012. """"We do anticipate that those areas will increase, but we don't have any new (endemic) areas yet,"""" said Mombourquette.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A total of 64 percent of reported Lyme disease cases have been from males. It is not that ticks prefer men. Ticks are opportunistic parasites and it seems more men and boys are in the woods	 for work or recreation	 than females.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Ticks are active when temperatures rise above 4 deg C [39.2 deg F], but Lyme disease can show up at any time of the year. The Lyme disease-carrying blacklegged ticks are very small. """"We do know that blacklegged _Ixodes_ ticks can carry 2 or 3 other [organisms (the rickettsia-like bacterium _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ and the protozoan _Babesia microti_)], as well as _Borrelia [burgdorferi_] that causes Lyme disease,"""" said Mombourquette.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Donna Lugar of the Nova Scotia Lyme Disease Support Group has the disease. """"I was diagnosed with 3 different tick-borne diseases in the summer of 2011,"""" Lugar said recently from her Bedford home. The diagnosis came after many years of symptoms, she said. """"I live in an endemic area. I've travelled to endemic areas."""" Fever, flu-like symptoms, and a bull's-eye rash are symptoms.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Ticks move around on a person's body, often ending up in a warm or moist area. Rashes may appear several days to a month after contact and may disappear and return, Lugar said. The Nova Scotia government could do a better job of informing people about tick activity, she said. """"Certainly the things that have happened in the last couple of years are really a result of a lot of screaming by those of us in the Lyme (disease) community,"""" she said about attracting more publicity to tick-related illnesses. She said a Health and Wellness Department information brochure is often hard to locate. """"It isn't anywhere. You have to almost specifically request it,"""" said Lugar, who began the support group this year [2014].;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The government knows public awareness is important. """"I think we're getting better and better at it every year,"""" said Mombourquette. She said having Lyme Disease Awareness Month for the 1st time is an important step. Blacklegged ticks must be attached to the skin for at least 24 hours before they can transmit disease, said a Health and Wellness Department fact sheet and news release. Wearing light-coloured clothing to better see ticks and wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts are advised. Clothing sprayed with insect-repellent-containing DEET or Icaridin is also recommended, said the news release. Everyone should check themselves thoroughly for ticks when they have been near grassy, shrubby, or wooded areas anywhere in the province, said the release.;;;;;;;;;;"

[This increase in numbers of reported cases of Lyme disease in Nova Scotia	 Canada is likely the result of several factors	 including enhanced case detection resulting from a greater awareness of Lyme disease and improved reporting	 as well as a true increase in disease incidence.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Factors that account for a true increase in disease incidence include climate change	 growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas	 and enlarging populations of deer	 white-footed mice and other small rodents	 and _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_. Deer	 although not susceptible to Lyme disease	 supply the adult tick with a required blood meal; white-footed mice and other small rodents are the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease; and nymphal _I. scapularis_ are the primary tick vector for Lyme disease in northeastern US and southeastern Canada. - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;

As the ticks that spread Lyme disease push ever further into Canada	 doctors are starting to notice an unusual fallout from the growing threat: a spike in the number of people seeking help for arthritis triggered by the bacteria [_Borrelia burgdorferi_].;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A new study from Halifax	 to be presented at an American College of Rheumatology conference in Florida this weekend [5-6 Apr 2014]	 documented 17 child arthritis patients	 most of whom surfaced over the last 2 years just in Lunenburg county [Lunenburg County is located on the South Shore of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia].;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Few had experienced any other symptoms and most had no idea they had Lyme [disease] until	 complaining of swollen	 painful joints	 they were referred to a rheumatologist. Once blood tests indicated they had the infection	 some were also diagnosed with related neurological problems.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In southern Ontario	 a public-health office near one of the province's several Lyme-disease areas has seen a 5-fold increase in cases in the last year	 many of the patients experiencing arthritis.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The majority of children ... never knew they were bitten by a tick. Arthritis was the very 1st presenting symptom of their Lyme disease,"""" said Dr. Elizabeth Stringer, a rheumatologist at Halifax's IWK Health Centre and co-author of the study. """"There have been some families who have been surprised, definitely."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The good news is that most cases can be cured with 1 to 3 courses of intravenous antibiotics	 though some people can have lingering effects.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The disease is caused by _Borrelia burgdorferi_ -- a """"spirochete"""" bacterium related to the bug that causes syphilis -- typically spread by black-legged deer ticks [_Ixodes scapularis_]. Most people experience a bulls-eye-like rash around the bite location, sores and fever in early stages, followed later, if untreated, by neurological symptoms like face-paralyzing Bell's palsy, heart problems or arthritis.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme is far more common in New England and some other parts of the United States than it is here	 but the tick has been moving deeper into Canada over the last several years. With endemic areas now in 6 provinces -- New Brunswick	 Nova Scotia	 Quebec	 Ontario	 Manitoba and British Columbia -- the number of infected Canadians reported to authorities has jumped to 315 in 2012 from 128 in 2009	 reports the Public Health Agency of Canada. Federal scientists have projected a further advance by the sesame-seed-sized ticks	 and more disease as a result.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"It makes sense that Dr. Stringer has seen what she called a """"sharp rise"""" in pediatric cases of Lyme arthritis, since children seem more likely to go undiagnosed until the bacteria causes joint inflammation, said Dr. Gordon Dow, an infectious disease specialist in Moncton, New Brunswick. In fact, it was a """"huge"""" jump in children diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis around Lyme, Connecticut, which led to the illness being discovered in the mid-1970s, he said. """"You could almost see pediatric arthritis as like the canary in the coal mine,"""" said Dr. Dow. """"You start seeing arthritis in one joint in a bunch of kids and that should trigger you to look for Lyme disease."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
IWK's pediatric rheumatology department began recording cases of Lyme arthritis in 2008. After a smattering of patients in the 1st few years	 about 3/4ths of the total so far came just in 2012 and 2013	 said Dr. Stringer. Half the children saw their symptoms disappear after one course of IV antibiotics	 while the rest required 2 or 3 courses. But 5 months after treatment	 2 patients still had arthritic symptoms that limited their functioning. A paper published in 2011 by doctors from Hershey	 Pennsylvania	 concluded that about 25 percent of children treated for Lyme arthritis will still suffer chronic musculoskeletal inflammation.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Chatham-Kent region in Ontario includes Rondeau Provincial Park, one of several parts of the province with Lyme disease-ticks. Though the annual number of cases the health unit has managed to identify is still under 10, it has jumped sharply in the last year, said Dr. David Colby of the Chatham-Kent Health Unit. """"There is often a delay in diagnosis, so [arthritis] is not at all uncommon,"""" he said. """"It can be quite severe, actually. Patients who go on to the 3rd stage can have chronic arthritis for months or years."""";;;;;;;;;;"

;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in North America and Europe	 but it is not common in Canada. The eastern black-legged ticks (_Ixodes scapularis_) have a more patchy distribution and are well established in some locations in Ontario along the shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario	 in southeastern Manitoba	 and in Bedford and the Lunenburg area of Nova Scotia. _Ixodes_ ticks are found intermittently in most provinces in Canada	 likely brought by migratory birds; 10 percent to 12 percent of these ticks may carry _Borrelia burgdorferi_. Therefore	 one could theoretically acquire Lyme disease from the bite of an infected tick anywhere in Canada but the chances are quite low	 except in areas where the eastern and western blacklegged tick populations are firmly established. Human cases of Lyme disease in Canada are primarily the result of travel to areas outside of Canada or areas in Canada mentioned above where infected ticks are well established. In 2010	 Lyme disease became a nationally reportable disease in Canada (<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/id-mi/lyme-fs-eng.php>).;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme arthritis is a late manifestation of the disease appearing months-to-years after the tick bite. Although Lyme arthritis was initially reported to occur in 60 percent of untreated patients with Lyme disease in the US	 the frequency has fallen considerably probably because of improved recognition and earlier treatment of patients with early Lyme disease (<http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedfiles/idsa/guidelines-patient_care/pdf_library/lyme%20disease.pdf>). Patients with Lyme arthritis may begin to have intermittent bouts of arthritis	 with severe joint pain and swelling. Large joints are most often affected	 particularly the knees.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme arthritis without clinical evidence of neurologic disease can usually be treated successfully with antimicrobial agents	 such as doxycycline (for adults and children 8 years of age or older)	 amoxicillin	 or cefuroxime axetil administered orally for 28 days. In about 10 percent of patients with Lyme arthritis	 joint swelling persists after recommended antimicrobial treatment courses and if untreated may lasted for up to 4-5 years in a few patients (<http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedfiles/idsa/guidelines-patient_care/pdf_library/lyme%20disease.pdf>)	 even though PCR for _B. burgdorferi_ of synovial fluid specimens or synovial tissue specimens	 if available	 are usually negative. The IDSA recommends retreatment in these patients with another 4-week course of oral antibiotics or with a 2- to 4-week course of ceftriaxone (<http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedfiles/idsa/guidelines-patient_care/pdf_library/lyme%20disease.pdf>). Arthroscopic synovectomy has been used successfully in the treatment of such patients. However	 it is important to recognize that a small number of patients treated with oral agents have subsequently manifested overt neuroborreliosis	 which may require intravenous therapy with ceftriaxone	 cefotaxime	 or penicillin G. ;;;;;;;;;;

Letter: Inept deer cull could increase Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
-------------------------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lyme disease is a serious concern on Long Island [NY] due to its prevalence, difficulty to properly diagnose, and potential for devastating lingering effects, as well as conflicting opinions on treatment protocols and efficacy [""""We tipped nature out of balance,"""" Opinion, 10 Feb 2014]. As a mother, I am particularly concerned about risks to my children and support research on how to decrease the incidence of this dangerous condition.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Many studies have shown that incidence of Lyme disease is not decreased in human populations until the deer population is greatly decreased -- by 90 percent or more. Furthermore	 human incidence of the disease is often increased for at least 2 years following smaller decreases in deer population	 as the ticks accept a large range of hosts. If deer aren't available	 humans are a good alternative.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Furthermore	 it's the 2nd stage of the ixodes tick's life cycle that is most dangerous to humans	 and that's when ticks are most commonly found on small rodents	 not deer. Several studies have shown that decreasing fox populations are correlated to increased Lyme disease diagnosis in humans. Researchers surmise this is because foxes help control the population of small rodents.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
I am concerned that unless we are prepared to cull 90 percent of deer and keep the population at this level	 we will not see any decrease in human Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Studies have shown possible decreases in Lyme disease when deer are treated with sprayed-on insecticide. Furthermore	 any programs to increase the population of birds of prey	 which hunt small rodents	 may be effective in decreasing human Lyme disease incidence.;;;;;;;;;;

While decreasing human Lyme disease is important	 severe culling of deer may not translate into a decrease in human Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis)	 an infectious disease is caused by at least 3 species of bacteria of the genus _Borrelia_.   _Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto_ is the primary cause of Lyme disease in North America. This is a spirochete bacterium with great genetic diversity.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The blacklegged tick or deer tick	 a hard body tick (_Ixodes scapularis_) is the main vector on the east coast of the United States. Other ticks and biting insects such as mosquitoes	 deer flies	 and horse flies have been shown to carry the Lyme disease bacterium.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The relationship between deer and the disease is complex. Deer show no symptoms of the disease. Deer may carry small numbers of the spirochete that causes Lyme disease but they are dead-end hosts for the bacterium. Deer cannot infect another animals directly and no deer hunter has acquired the disease from dressing out a deer. Infected ticks that drop from deer present little risk to humans or other animals since the ticks are now at the end of their life cycle and will not feed again.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
These ticks are just as capable of being on dogs	 or cats	 or any human. These ticks are very adaptable to a variety of hosts. Culling deer does not prevent the tick from adapting to dogs	 cats	 people	 horses	 or any other hosts. Likewise with mosquitoes	 deer flies	 and horse flies more than capable of carrying the bacterium	 culling deer may not solve the Lyme disease problem.;;;;;;;;;;																
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The incidence of disease is due to a number of factors including:;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The tiny nymphal stage of the tick and the adult tick can both transmit the disease. The nymph is very tiny	 about the size of a poppy seed or smaller	 so it is easy to see why people do not recognize when they have a tick on them. It is also why some people do not get early treatment. Ticks can be almost anywhere a warm blooded host is.;;;;;;;;;;

The author of the letter argues that not culling enough deer might be counterproductive	 increasing instead of decreasing the incidence of Lyme disease in humans. In the East Coast of North America	 Lyme disease is transmitted by _Ixodes scapularis_	 a tick that uses 3 hosts to complete its cycle	 each for one of its stages: larva	 nymph	 and adult.;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
When a larva feeds on an infected rodent	 after molting to nymph it can transmit the _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (the causative agent of Lyme disease) to the next host it feeds on. Adult ticks can also transmit the pathogen if they fed on infected rodents at an earlier stage	 but it is less likely that an adult tick transmits the disease to a human	 as adults are larger and easily spotted before they have been attached long enough to inoculate the pathogen. Deer are the preferred hosts for adult ticks. More deer represents more opportunities for female ticks to engorge and lay hundreds of eggs that will produce larvae that primarily feed on rodents	 some of which will be infected. Therefore	 while culling low numbers of deer may not result in a significant effect on the incidence of Lyme disease in humans	 it is unlikely that it results in an increase of it (at least in the long term).  Adults may seek alternative hosts	 but then there would be less larvae in the next generation	 because females are less able to succeed. - Mod.PMB];;;;;;;;;;

With a record 3609 cases of Lyme disease in 2011	 this tickborne illness has become Wisconsin's 3rd most reported ailment	 behind only chlamydia (24 254) and gonorrhea (4761). [The number of Lyme disease cases in 2011 (3609) is likely probable plus confirmed cases of Lyme disease (<http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/communicable/tickborne/Lyme/2010Data.htm>). The CDC says that the number of confirmed Lyme disease cases reported in Wisconsin peaked at 2505 in the year 2010	 then fell to 2408 in 2011	 and fell again to 1368 in 2012 (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html>).];;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Diep """"Zip"""" Hoang Johnson, an epidemiologist with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services [DHS], discussed the increase Wednesday [12 Mar 2014] at the annual winter meeting of the Wisconsin Chapter of the Wildlife Society. Johnson said Wisconsin recorded more than 18 000 Lyme disease cases between 2002 and 2011 -- more than triple the 5716 cases reported between 1990 and 2001. [The CDC says that there were almost 15 000 confirmed Lyme disease cases reported in Wisconsin between 2003 and 2011 -- from 740 in 2003 to 2408 in 2011 (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html>).];;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
One reason is the tick responsible for Lyme disease has expanded its range. In surveys from 1981 through 2007	 the black-legged tick [_Ixodes scapularis_] -- commonly called deer tick -- was most common in western Wisconsin.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The DHS' Division of Public Health and University of Wisconsin detected the tick's eastward expansion in 2008 while inspecting nearly 800 hunter-killed deer in eastern Wisconsin. They found the tick in 18 of the 21 counties they checked. Their research was published in the May 2013 issue of the Journal of Medical Entomology. """"The results indicate that range expansion of (black-legged ticks) is continuing and the risk of tick exposure is increasing, especially in the eastern one-third of the state,"""" the article reported. [Lee X, Hardy K, Johnson DH, Paskewitz SM: Hunter-Killed Deer Surveillance to Assess Changes in the Prevalence and Distribution of _Ixodes scapularis_ (Acari: Ixodidae) in Wisconsin. J Med Entomology 2013; 50(3): 632-9; abstract available at <http://www.bioone.org/doi/ref/10.1603/ME12234>.];;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Johnson also warned that Lyme disease isn't Wisconsin's only tickborne disease. While the 1906 cases reported so far from 2012 represent 75 percent of the year's tick-related diseases	 Wisconsin also had 586 cases of anaplasmosis/ehrlichiosis (2 similar diseases)	 which accounted for 23 percent of the cases.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Black-legged ticks spread all 3 diseases. These ticks are smaller than the common wood tick or dog tick	 which doesn't cause human-health problems. [Incorrect. The American dog tick (_Dermacentor variabilis_) is the most commonly identified species responsible for transmitting _Rickettsia rickettsii_	 which causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever in humans	 and can also transmit _Francisella tularensis_	 the cause of tularemia. The Rocky Mountain wood tick (_Dermacentor andersoni_) can also transmit Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia to humans. See <http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/geographic_distribution.html>.] An adult female black-legged tick	 which is dark brown to reddish orange	 is the largest of its species	 yet measures less than 1/8-inch [3 mm]	 about the size of a large sesame seed.;;;;;;;;;;																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
However	 most Lyme-disease victims get infected when bitten by black-legged ticks in spring and summer during their nymph stage	 when they look like poppy seeds. June and July produce the year's most Lyme disease cases	 typically accounting for 60 percent of them. When including cases from May and August	 the 4-month period accounts for 80 percent of annual cases. [See <http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/communicable/tickborne/Lyme/2010Data.htm>.];;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Because black-legged tick nymphs are so small	 many people never know they've been bitten. Further	 about 20 percent of victims never develop Lyme disease's brand: a red bull's-eye skin rash. Only when experiencing fevers	 fatigue	 and headaches do they realize they might have Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
To reduce risks when outdoors	 Johnson recommends using permethrin or DEET of 20 percent concentrations on light-colored clothing. Also	 wear long-sleeve shirts and tuck pants inside boots when venturing off beaten paths into brush	 tall grasses	 and other vegetation. Ticks don't jump or fly. They simply climb aboard as we push through vegetation they inhabit.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"When returning indoors, thoroughly check for ticks. Next, take a shower and scrub vigorously to wash away unseen ticks. """"A shower reduces your risk by about 95 percent,"""" Johnson said. Don't panic if you find a blacklegged tick. Even if it's a nymph, 78 percent don't carry the Lyme bacteria. [An average of 22 percent of blacklegged tick (_I. scapularis_) nymphs in Wisconsin have been reported to be infected with _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the cause of Lyme disease (<http://labs.russell.wisc.edu/wisconsin-ticks/lyme-disease/>).] Further, they must stay attached at least 24 to 48 hours to transmit the bacteria.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Because Lyme disease is endemic in Wisconsin, the US Centers for Disease Control considers a tick-caused rash larger than 5 centimeters [2 in] a confirmed case of Lyme, even without a laboratory test. [The CDC defines erythema migrans, for purposes of surveillance, as """"a skin lesion that typically begins as a red macule or papule and expands over a period of days to weeks to form a large round lesion, often with partial central clearing. A single primary lesion must reach greater than or equal to 5 cm [2 in] in size across its largest diameter."""" (<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/script/casedef.aspx?CondYrID=752&DatePub=1/1/2011>).];;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease affects all age groups	 but is most prevalent in children 5 to 14	 and adults 55 to 74. It's least common in 25- to 29-year-olds and people 85 and older. Johnson thinks youngsters pick it up more often because they often roll in grass and play in brushy areas	 while older people tend to spend more time outdoors gardening and landscaping. [See <http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/communicable/tickborne/Lyme/2010Data.htm>.];;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Antibiotics are effective if used early. Adults and children 8 and older are usually cured by taking 100 mg doses of doxycycline twice daily for 2 weeks. In fact	 Lyme disease can usually be prevented if adults take one 200 mg dose of doxycycline within 72 hours of removing a tick.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"However, if you have no symptoms or no evidence of a tick bite, it's a waste of money to insist on a laboratory test. """"Screening tests do you no good,"""" Johnson said. """"They're a waste of time."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Once cured	 there's no lasting immunity against Lyme disease. People can get infected more than once. [Reinfection has been well-documented only after successfully treated early infection (nearly always erythema migrans) and not after late manifestations of Lyme disease (<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/8/1032.full>).] Also	 no vaccines for humans have been available since 2002. The 1st and only licensed vaccine against Lyme	 LYMERix	 was effective but expensive	 and required a 3-dose series. When many patients didn't get the follow-up doses	 and insurance companies didn't cover it	 the manufacturer ceased production.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
If you find a tick attached to your skin	 remove it with a tweezers or tissue pinched between your fingers. Pull it straight out	 not at an angle	 and flush it down the toilet. Finally	 cleanse the wound in alcohol and wash with soap and water.;;;;;;;;;;

[Lyme disease	 caused by the spirochete _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 is distributed focally within the United States: it is considered endemic in 8 northeastern states (Connecticut	 Delaware	 Maryland	 Massachusetts	 New Jersey	 New York	 Pennsylvania	 and Rhode Island) and 2 upper Midwestern states (Wisconsin and Minnesota). These regions of the US correspond with the known geographic distribution of the Lyme disease vector _Ixodes scapularis_	 the blacklegged or deer tick.;;;;;;;;;;															
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Climate change	 growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas	 and enlarging populations of deer as well as of the white-footed mouse and other small rodents (the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease) are thought to be responsible for the spread of the disease (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5623a1.htm>).;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Both _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_	 which infects blood monocytes	 and _Ehrlichia ewingii_	 which infects granulocytes	 cause human ehrlichiosis in the US	 although the majority of reported cases are due to _E. chaffeensis_. E. chaffeensis is most common in the south central and southeastern states	 which correspond with the known geographic distribution of the lone star tick (_Amblyomma americanum_). The lone star tick transmits both _E. chaffeensis_ and _E. ewingii_. _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_	 a bacterium closely related to the ehrlichiae	 causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis. However unlike _E. chaffeensis_ and _E. ewingii_	 _A. phagocytophilum_ (as well as _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and _Babesia microti_) are transmitted in the US by the ticks _I. scapularis_ and _Ixodes pacificus_.;;;;;;;;;;																
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Human ehrlichiosis was thought to be very rare or absent in Minnesota and Wisconsin	 because the northern range for _A. americanum_ is not thought to extend into Wisconsin and Minnesota. In fact	 in a 2009 study	 of the 1518 blood specimens obtained from patients with suspected ehrlichiosis in Wisconsin and Minnesota residents	 none were positive for _E. chaffeensis_ or _E. ewingii_	 although 163 (10.7 percent) were positive for _A. phagocytophilum_ (35 from Wisconsin and 128 from Minnesota). In addition	 infection by a new species of _Ehrlichia_ carried by the deer tick _I. scapularis_ was found in 4 patients (3 from Wisconsin	 1 from Minnesota) [Pritt BS	 Sloan LM	 Johnson DH	 et al: Emergence of a New Pathogenic _Ehrlichia_ Species	 Wisconsin and Minnesota	 2009. N Engl J Med 2011; 365(5): 422-9 doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1010493; available at <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010493>]. The unique nucleotide sequence of this new species was similar to that of _Ehrlichia muris_	 a species not previously identified in North America. - Mod.ML;;;;;;;;

The sudden deaths of 3 young people in the Northeast [of the USA] have been attributed to complications of Lyme disease	 Boston.com reported.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [1]	 each of the fatalities resulted from undetected heart inflammation -- also known as carditis -- caused by the tick-borne illness. About one percent of Lyme disease sufferers develop carditis	 which is typically treatable with antibiotics or	 in some cases	 a pacemaker.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
According to medical reports	 only 4 other deaths can be attributed to heart inflammation caused by Lyme disease. While the illness is a growing problem in the Northeast	 the CDC says that deaths related to the disease are still rare	 Boston.com reported.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The victims in the CDC's report were not identified	 but each of the deaths occurred between November 2012 and July 2013. The deceased were between 26 and 38 years old. None of the victims had been diagnosed with Lyme disease prior to their deaths.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
One of the victims died in a car accident after his car veered off the road. The victim was an organ donor	 and the inflammation around his heart was discovered during a pathology exam. It is believed he went into cardiac arrest while driving	 Boston.com reported. The other 2 victims also died after seemingly unexplainable collapses.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Medical professionals say these deaths should bring new urgency to the search for a Lyme disease vaccine. """"I think it is unconscionable and a discredit to all parties -- public health, manufacturers, Lyme activists -- that no Lyme vaccine is available to humans while there is one for dogs,"""" Stanley Plotkin, emeritus professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania and a vaccine expert, told Boston.com in an email.;;;;;;;;;;"

1. CDC: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Weekly. Three Sudden Cardiac Deaths Associated with Lyme Carditis -- United States	 November 2012-July 2013. MMWR 2013; 62(49): 993-6. Available at <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6249a1.htm>.;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme carditis is a manifestation of early disseminated Lyme disease	 which results in secondary skin lesions and extracutaneous manifestations that occurs during the initial weeks to months of infection. Symptoms related to this stage occur in at least 50 percent of all untreated patients. Carditis has been reported in up to 10 percent of cases of Lyme disease and can cause life-threatening cardiac conduction abnormalities that can result in sudden death. The diagnosis is made primarily on clinical grounds and confirmed by serologic testing. Patients who have severe heart block with hemodynamic instability frequently need placement of a temporary cardiac pacemaker. The cardiac conduction block resolves completely with antibiotic treatment.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The recent CDC publication	 which the news release above refers to (reference 1 above)	 describes 3 individuals who experienced sudden cardiac death during November 2012-July 2013 and were found to have evidence of Lyme carditis on postmortem examination. To quote from this article (references omitted	 available from the original article):;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
_Borrelia burgdorferi_ has been shown to affect all layers of the heart	 but tends to spare the great vessels and heart valves. Inflammation is characteristically diffuse	 perivascular	 lymphohistiocytic	" and plasma cell-rich. Spirochetes can be found within the myocardial cellular infiltrates;"" IHC [immunohistochemistry] and PCR [polymerase chain reaction] testing can provide additional evidence of infection. Although Lyme carditis usually is present in conjunction with other features of the disease"	 such as erythema migrans	 arthritis	 or neurologic disease	 it can be observed independently. The most common cardiac manifestation is atrioventricular block	 which can fluctuate between 1st	 2nd	 and 3rd degree. 2nd-degree or 3rd-degree atrioventricular block occurs in approximately 0.8 percent of all Lyme disease cases reported to CDC. Symptoms of atrioventricular block	 including lightheadedness	 palpitations	 shortness of breath	 chest pain	 and syncope can occur 4 days to 7 months after onset of disease	 with a median of 21 days. With appropriate therapy	 prognosis is excellent	 and signs of cardiac involvement typically resolve within 1-6 weeks	" depending on the degree of conduction disturbance. Some cases of complete heart block might require temporary pacing."""""""""";;;;;;;;;"

It's more important than ever to check for ticks this season. Lyme disease cases are on the rise in Central New York. According to the most recent data from New York State Department of Health [year 2011]	 every county in Central New York has seen more Lyme cases nearly every year since at least 2005 [<http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/diseases/communicable/2011/cases/4.htm>].;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In 2011	 Tompkins County had 145 cases	 the most in the area	 and Onondaga County had 86 that same year. Just 8 years ago	 no county in Central New York had more than 10 reported cases in one year. The graph and table attached to this story show the rise in the prevalence of the disease over time. Local doctors expect this trend to continue.;;;;;;;;;;

"Lyme disease is real and it's out there,"""" said Dr. Mitchell Brodey, the chief of internal medicine at Upstate University Hospital Community Campus. """"We see a lot of it and we're probably going to see a lot more of it."""";;;;;;;;;;"

 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Ticks that can carry Lyme disease are tiny: adults only grow to be the size of a sesame seed. It can take 24-36 hours for a tick to transmit the disease	 so it's important to check for them daily.;;;;;;;;;;

[The latest data from the CDC	 dated May 6	 2013 on the reported number of confirmed cases of Lyme disease by state and the District of Columbia for the years 2002 to 2011 and the incidence of confirmed cases per 100 000 population by state and the District of Columbia for the year 2011 can be found at <http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html>. In 2011	 according to the CDC	 3 states with the highest number of confirmed cases of Lyme disease were Pennsylvania (4739)	 New Jersey (3378) and New York (3118). The respective incidence rates of confirmed cases per 100 000 population were 37.2	 38.5 and 16.0.  The states with the highest incidence rates of confirmed cases in 2011 were Delaware (84.6)	 New Hampshire (67.3)	 Maine (60.3)	 and Connecticut (56.0). Thus	 New York State had neither the highest number of confirmed cases	 nor the highest incidence rate in the USA in 2011. ;;;;;;;;;;

Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 and is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. In areas of the northeastern	 mid-Atlantic and Upper Midwest where Lyme disease is endemic	 the white-footed mouse is the principal reservoir for _B. burgdorferi_ and _I. scapularis_ is the tick vector. The western black-legged tick (_I. pacificus_) is the main vector on the west coast	 where only 2-4 percent of _I. pacificus_ are reported to be infected with _B. burgdorferi_	 whereas over 50 percent of _I. scapularis_ are infected in hyper-endemic areas in the northeastern states (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2446842/>).;;;;;;;;;;

Numbers of confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported to the CDC in the years 2009	2010	 and 2011 from the state of Oregon were 12	7	 and 9	 respectively	 and from Washington State 15	12	 and 17	 respectively (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html>). In fact	 about 40 percent of cases of Lyme disease reported in Washington State are probably infected while outside of this state (<http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/communicable/diseases/LymeDisease/facts.aspx>). Similarly	 over 40 percent of Lyme disease cases reported from the greater Portland (Oregon) metropolitan area from 1999 to 2004 likely acquired Lyme disease outside of Oregon (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2446842/>). Most locally acquired cases likely acquired Lyme disease during outdoor exposure in the western half of these states on the western slope of the Cascade mountain range or in the Cascade foothills	 where _I. pacificus_ is prevalent. The Cascade Range extends from northern California to British Columbia (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cascaderangemap.jpg>).;;;;;;;;;;											
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The western black-legged tick (_Ixodes pacificus_) is the main vector on the west coast	 where only 2-4 percent of _I. pacificus_ are reported to be infected with _B. burgdorferi_	 whereas over 50 percent of _I. scapularis_ are infected in hyper-endemic areas in the northeastern states (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2446842/>).;;;;;;;;;;

[I appreciate my sharp-eyed readers. ProMED-mail does not endorse an incorrect measure of removing ticks from animals. Pulling straight back	 not twisting the tick	 is a much better technique and will likely result in the removal of the whole tick	 rather than a portion of the tick.;;;;;;;;;;

With national attention fixed on the dramatic upswing in the number of Lyme disease cases in Pennsylvania and New Jersey [see ProMed-mail post Lyme disease - USA: (PA	NJ) increased incidence 20120423.1111304]	 little attention has been focused on New York State. Yet	 the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control reveals that New York ranks third in the nation in the number of reported cases. 357 cases of Lyme disease have been diagnosed in New York through the report's cutoff data of April 28 [2012	 <http://wonder.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_reps.asp?mmwr_table=2F&mmwr_year=2012&mmwr_week=17>. The CDC in a footnote says the case counts for reporting years 2011 and 2012 are provisional and subject to change.];;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
New York has reported 8.2 percent of all the Lyme disease cases in the period January 1 through April 28	 2012. 357 cases of the illness have been diagnosed this year	 an increase over the 339 cases reported in the same period in 2011. Only four cases have been found in New York City	 though last year there were 143 [<http://wonder.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_reps.asp?mmwr_table=2F&mmwr_year=2012&mmwr_week=17>].;;;;;;;;;;

A quote from this article says actually that, """"While entomologists say that the mild weather in much of the country this winter is unlikely to spawn a tick population explosion this spring and summer, they suggest that just like humans and dogs, the pesky critters appear to be enjoying the great outdoors a month or two earlier this year.""""]. Ticks, primarily the deer tick, carry Lyme disease and can infect both animals and humans. Downstate New York the lower Hudson valley, New York City and Long Island have been one of the historic hot spots for human cases of Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
New Jersey leads the nation with 1	677 cases of Lyme disease in 2012	 followed by Pennsylvania with 969. New York borders both states	 which may help account for the higher number of cases in the state this year. Nine states have over 100 cases	 all in New England or the Mid-Atlantic except for Virginia[	 Maryland and Delaware	 which are categorized among the South Atlantic states] [<http://wonder.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_reps.asp?mmwr_table=2F&mmwr_year=2012&mmwr_week=17>].;;;;;;;;;;

Pictou County vets are finding a large number of animals with ticks this year [2012]. Numerous have tested positive for Lyme disease	 a tickborne illness.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Vet clinics throughout the county are reporting incidents of dogs with Lyme disease	 an illness transmitted by black legged ticks	 which are now known to populate various areas of the county.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dr Brenda Spence-MacLeod of the Pictou Veterinary Clinic said she has had 2 confirmed cases this spring of dogs with Lyme disease with the most recent confirmation arriving just last week [week of 21 May 2012].;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Like many other clinics in the county	 she is seeing more canines coming in with ticks and tick bites	 which are something that people in this area had never had to think about in the past. Even last year [2011]	 she said she didn't see it as much of a problem.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"I am more concerned about it this year,"""" she said. She said that there are a lot of dogs who aren't tested who could also be carrying the disease, but just aren't showing clinical signs.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dr Kathryn Finlayson of the East River Animal Hospital said she's tested about 50 dogs over the last year with 5 coming back positive for Lyme disease. She was able to successfully treat 4 while the 5th had to be euthanized.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Every day we get ticks coming in from pets from all over,"""" she said. The ones that tested positive ranged from Abercrombie to Merigomish, she said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Not all ticks carry Lyme disease and even those that do won't transmit the disease until they engorged	 which can take up to 48 hours	 but because of the presence of the black-legged ticks in the area	 she like other vets has been recommending that pet owners vaccinate their dogs. While the vaccine doesn't prevent dogs from getting bit by ticks it does greatly reduce the likelihood of them getting Lyme disease. There are also medications available for dogs that repel ticks and will kill them if they bite.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Vets caution that medication is toxic to cats though and people who own both dogs and cats should be careful to keep their dogs away from their cats when they're being treated.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
While ticks can be out any time of year	 Finlayson said we are heading into peak season and people should be sure to be checking their pets.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Abercrombie Animal Hospital Veterinarian Dr Kelly Hodder said they've had 2 dogs that have tested positive for Lyme in the past year as well and seen numerous other animals who have picked up ticks. While she's seen some on cats	 it's more common on dogs and the chances of getting bitten vary to an extent with geography.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
She and Dr Finlayson both said that cats tend to be better groomers than dogs	 which may be one reason why they aren't as susceptible to ticks. Dogs that have been infected with Lyme disease may show signs of lameness for no apparent reason	 fatigue	 or depression among other signs.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
If you do find a tick on your pet you can remove it with a pair of tweezers and turning counter clockwise as you pull. If for some reason part of the tick remains	 vets recommend scrubbing the area with soapy water. Hodder said people should be careful not to touch the tick with the bare hands.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
New Glasgow resident Brenda Sterling-Goodwin believes she contracted Lyme disease while she was working at a vet clinic and she said people need to be more aware about the disease and how common it is in this area.;;;;;;;;;;

[Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and is spread by ticks. Ticks become infected with the bacteria by feeding on infected mice and other small animals. When an infected tick bites other animals	 it can transmit the bacteria to these animals. The deer tick is small and may bite animals and people without being detected.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease affects a variety of species	 including dogs	 cats	 and people. Up to 95 percent of dogs infected with _B. burgdorferi_ do not develop clinical signs (people are much more likely to become ill with Lyme disease). There is no evidence that Lyme disease is spread by direct contact with infected animals. However	 ticks can hitch a ride home on your pets and move on to the humans in the household.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dogs spending a lot of time outdoors	 especially in the woods	 bush	 or areas of tall grass are most commonly infected with Lyme disease. However	 ticks can be carried into yards on other animals	 and dogs can become infected anywhere ticks are found.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Infections occur during tick season which is usually spring through early fall	 but the time between infection and the appearance of clinical signs of Lyme disease can be up to 2-5 months.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
When signs do develop	 they may be transient or recurrent	 and may include: fever	 decreased appetite or lack of appetite (anorexia)	 swollen	 painful joints making the dog reluctant to move	 lameness -- limping which may be mild at first	 then worsen	 and may also shift from one leg to another	 lethargy	 and swollen lymph nodes.;;;;;;;;;;															
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Some dogs with Lyme disease may develop kidney disease. Signs can include depression	 vomiting	 loss of appetite	 and increased thirst and urination (sometimes a lack of urination will develop). Dogs developing kidney disease can become very ill and may not respond to treatment.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Neurological disease (behavioral changes	 seizures) and heart complications	 which are sometimes seen in humans	 are rare in dogs.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The diagnosis of Lyme disease must be based on a combination of factors	 including history (tick exposure; occasionally exposure may be missed)	 clinical signs	 finding antibodies to _B. burgdorferi_ bacteria	 and a quick response to treatment with antibiotics. A positive antibody test is not enough to make a diagnosis on its own	 because not all dogs that are exposed to _B. burgdorferi_ get sick	 and antibodies can persist in the blood for a long time after exposure.;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Other diagnostic tests such as blood and urine tests	 may be done to check for signs of kidney disease and to rule out other conditions with similar signs. Additional tests may include x-rays and sampling of joint fluid.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Treatment with antibiotics usually produces a rapid improvement in signs. Antibiotics generally need to be continued for several weeks. Treatment may not completely clear the bacteria	 but produces a state where no signs are present.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
If kidney disease is present	 a longer course of antibiotics along with additional medications to treat the kidney disease is usually necessary.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Kidney disease may develop some time after the initial infection	 so it is a good idea to regularly visit your veterinarian to check for excess protein in the urine of dogs that have had Lyme disease. Catching the kidney disease early in its course offers the best prognosis.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Tick control is extremely important for the prevention of Lyme disease and other diseases transmitted by ticks. Check your dog daily for ticks and remove them as soon as possible	 since ticks must feed for at least 12 hours and maybe as long as 24-48 hours before transmitting the bacteria causing Lyme disease. This is especially important in peak tick season and after your dog spends time in the bush or tall grass areas	 which you may want to avoid in tick season.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Products that prevent ticks such as monthly parasite preventatives (for example	 Frontline(R)	 Revolution(R)) or tick collars (for example	 Preventic(R)) can be used. Be sure to follow your veterinarian's advice when using these products. Keep grass and brush trimmed in your yard	 and in areas where ticks are a serious problem	 you can also consider treating your yard for ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There are excellent vaccines available but some people are reluctant to use them because the disease is relatively easy to treat.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Vaccination before exposure can help prevent dogs from getting Lyme disease and also prevent them from becoming carriers of the bacteria. Where vaccines are used	 it is usually recommended to start vaccinating dogs as young puppies	 by 12 weeks	 with a booster 2-4 weeks later. The vaccine does not provide long lasting immunity	 so annual revaccination prior to tick season is necessary. The recombinant form of the vaccine is considered to have less potential for side effects than the bacterin forms of the vaccine.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Risk	 vaccination	 and health issues related to Lyme disease and your area should be discussed with your veterinarian. It is tick season so please discuss this before your pet is affected.;;;;;;;;;;

From spending time with family to getting exercise and enjoying the beauty of nature	 there are many reasons to love the outdoors. One thing that people who enjoy outdoor recreation don't love	 however	 are ticks. But thanks to the mild winter [2011-2012]	 the disease-carrying arachnids are already out in full force this year [2012].;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In this area	 the biggest threat from ticks	 specifically the blacklegged tick (_Ixodes scapularis_)	 also known as the deer tick	 is Lyme disease	 which can be transmitted when a tick carrying the disease passes it on to a human after attaching itself to feed. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)	 more than 250 000 cases of Lyme disease have been reported in the United States since 2000. In 2009	 the last year for which complete statistics are available	 New Jersey had 4598 confirmed cases -- its most ever in one year -- while Pennsylvania had 4950.;;;;;;;;;;																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The incidence of Lyme disease has increased in Pennsylvania over the past decade,"""" said St Luke's University Health Network director of healthcare epidemiology and infection prevention Dr Kara Mascitti. """"It's unclear if that is due to an increased recognition and diagnosis of the disease, or if there is an actual increase in the number of ticks in the area."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
While ticks normally become active in spring	 this year's [2012] mild winter has brought them out earlier than normal. Although the adults	 which are actively feeding now	 can transmit the disease	 CDC reports that most humans are infected by immature ticks known as nymphs	 which feed spring through summer.;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"When it comes to preventing tick bites, there are several precautions a person can take. The best way to minimize the threat of Lyme disease is to keep contact with the bloodsuckers to a minimum. """"This can be done by avoiding places where they are most likely found, including wooded and bushy areas, or areas with high grass. If you do anticipate contact with one of these high risk areas, it's important to wear a hat, long sleeves and pants, and to use insect repellant containing 20 per cent or more DEET on the exposed skin,"""" Mascitti said. """"It's also important to do a thorough tick check when returning indoors to remove any ticks that might have gotten on you despite these measures. Showering immediately upon returning indoors can also wash away ticks that haven't yet attached to the skin."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"When doing a visual inspection for ticks, no area should be overlooked. """"Because ticks like hard-to-see areas of the body, you should pay close attention to the armpits, in and around the ears, behind the knees, in the groin and underneath the hair,"""" Mascitti said. """"It's also important to check any gear, pets, etc. that may have accompanied you outside, as these can carry ticks inside your home that can later make their way onto your body."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
As for clothing and gear that comes in contact with the body such as backpacks	 it's a good idea to treat them with a permethrin-based product designed to kill and repel ticks. CDC also recommends putting clothes in the dryer for one hour on high heat to kill any ticks that may be on them. While turkey hunters	 anglers	 hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts know how easy it is to pick up ticks while moving through woods or brush	 the reality is that each year countless unsuspecting individuals are bitten by the arachnids while they are working	 gardening or playing right in their own backyards. To help reduce the risk of picking up ticks in the yard	 CDC recommends people take preventive actions such as mowing the lawn regularly	 removing leaf litter from their yards and clearing tall grasses and brush from around their houses and the edge of yards. If you do find a tick on you	 the best way to remove it is to grab it as close to the skin as possible and pull up with a steady	 consistent motion. Afterward	 wash your hands and the bite area thoroughly with rubbing alcohol or soap and water.;;;;;;;;;;															
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Experts say a tick must be attached for at least 36 hours for the Lyme disease bacterium to be transmitted. If you do exhibit signs of the disease, it's important to consult your family doctor or an infectious disease specialist for proper diagnosis and treatment. In most cases, antibiotics are prescribed to treat Lyme disease, and, according to CDC, patients who take the appropriate antibiotics in the early stages of the disease usually make a rapid and complete recovery. """"Early Lyme disease usually presents like a """"summertime flu"""", with headache and body aches, fevers and chills, and fatigue,"""" Mascitti said. """"Often people will notice the classic bull's-eye-like red rash."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"That rash, called erythema migrans, as well as the other symptoms, will usually occur within a few days to a month after a person is bitten by an infected tick. And while the rash can be an indicator that Lyme disease is present, it isn't noticeable in every case. """"The bull's-eye rash is a tell-tale sign, but, unfortunately, it is found in only 70-80 per cent of cases,"""" Mascitti said. """"Or, if it occurs, it can occur in an area where it might not be immediately noticed, like the back, armpit or under the hair."""";;;;;;;;;;"

[Although there has been marked year-to-year variation	 the number of confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported in the US increased by about 70 per cent	 from 17 730 to almost 30 000 cases for the years 2000-2009; and the number for the state of Pennsylvania more than doubled	 from 2343 to 4950; and the number for the state of New Jersey increased 87 per cent	 from 2459 to 4598 during this period (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html>).

Abstract;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
--------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Background. Tick-borne illnesses represent an important class of emerging zoonoses	 with climate change projected to increase the geographic range within which tick-borne zoonoses might become endemic. We evaluated the impact of latitude on the rate of change in the incidence of Lyme disease in the United States	 using publicly available data.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Methods. We estimated state-level year-on-year incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for Lyme disease for the period 1993 to 2007 using Poisson regression methods. We evaluated between-state heterogeneity in IRRs using a random-effects meta-analytic approach. We identified state-level characteristics associated with increasing incidence using random-effects meta-regression.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Results. The incidence of Lyme disease in the US increased by about 80 percent between 1993 and 2007 (IRR per year 1.049	 95 percent CI [confidence interval] 1.048 to 1.050). There was marked between-state heterogeneity in the average incidence of Lyme disease	 ranging from 0.008 per 100 000 person-years in Colorado to 75 per 100 000 in Connecticut	 and significant between-state heterogeneity in temporal trends (p less than 0.001). In multivariable meta-regression models	 increasing incidence showed a linear association with state latitude and population density. These 2 factors explained 27 percent of the between-state variation in IRRs. No independent association was identified for other state-level characteristics.;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Interpretation. Lyme disease incidence increased in the US as a whole during the study period	 but the changes were not uniform. Marked increases were identified in northern-most states	 whereas southern states experienced stable or declining rates of Lyme disease.];;;;;;;;;;

Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 and is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. In areas of the northeastern	 mid-Atlantic and north-central United States where Lyme disease is endemic	 the white-footed mouse is the principal reservoir for _B. burgdorferi_ and _I. scapularis_ is the tick vector. The western black-legged tick (_I. pacificus_) is the main vector on the west coast	 where only 2-4 percent of _I. pacificus_ are reported to be infected with _B. burgdorferi_	 whereas over 50 percent of _I. scapularis_ are infected in hyper-endemic areas in the northeastern states (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2446842/>).;;;;;;;;;;

Ticks that can transmit Lyme disease may be more prevalent in the UK than realised	 say researchers who have found out how many dogs harbour them.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Experts have suspected for some time that the UK has a growing problem with these tiny pests - rates of the disease have been creeping up in recent years. In 2010 there were 953 reported cases in England and Wales.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Now	 after doing random checks on over 3	500 dogs	 Bristol University experts suspects the problem is even bigger. Of the 3	534 pet dogs inspected at veterinary clinics in the UK between March and October 2009	 14.9% had ticks. Of these	 2.3% turned out to be infected. The expected prevalence of infected ticks on dogs is 0.5% or 481 infected ticks per 100	000 dogs.;;;;;;;;;;																		
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
This suggests that the prevalence of this _Borrelia_ infection in the UK tick population is considerably higher than previously thought	 the researchers report in the journal Comparative Immunology	 Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Faith Smith, who led the research, said: """"Lyme disease appears to be a rapidly growing problem in the UK with important health and economic impacts in terms of loss of working hours and potential decrease in tourism to tick hotspots. """"Without considerably better surveillance and routine diagnostic testing, Lyme disease is only likely to become more prevalent. In particular, future warmer winters might well extend the period over which ticks are active seasonally, while growing wild reservoir host populations, such as deer, will allow the tick population to expand."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"A bite from an infected tick can take between two days and four weeks to show and anyone who has been bitten should look for a """"bulls eye"""" type red rash appearing around the bite. You may also experience flu-like symptoms, such as tiredness, headaches and muscle or joint pain. Untreated, Lyme disease can spread to the brain, heart, and joints and in extreme can cause nerve damage, paralysis and blindness.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Ticks are very small - about the size of a poppy seed - and can easily be overlooked. Most ticks do not carry the infection	 but they should be removed promptly if found.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
They can be removed with tweezers or special tick hooks	 pulling gently upwards away from the skin. People who develop a rash or other symptoms after a tick bite should consult their GP.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"A spokeswoman from the Health Protection Agency said it was important that people realise the risks and remain """"tick aware"""". """"They are out there in woodland areas."""" She said it was best to keep to footpaths and avoid long grass where possible when out walking and to cover up the skin. Also, brush off clothes and pet's coats before returning indoors to remove any unattached ticks that might later seek a feed.;;;;;;;;;;"

;;;;;;;;;;																									
[Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere	 occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America	 Europe and Asia. It is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete	 _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato group. Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks	 and various small and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts. ;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The species of tick	 the host species	 borrelial genospecies and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the only pathogenic species identified in North America. It also occurs in Europe but is less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_	 the two major European pathogenic genospecies; All are present in the United Kingdom (UK)	 and _B. garinii_ appears to be the most prevalent pathogenic genospecies in most endemic areas of this country (<http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1309968694565>). ;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In Europe	 _B. burgdorferi_ genospecies that cause Lyme borreliosis are mainly transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. In a literature review of studies of the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato in _I. ricinus_ ticks in various European countries	 the overall mean prevalence of _B. burgdorferi _ in ticks was 13.7%; For the UK the prevalence ranged from 3.9 to 8.5 (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/>).;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Increases in incidence of Lyme disease are likely the result of several factors that include: 1) greater recognition	 2) improved reporting	 as well as 3) a true increase in disease incidence due to more people living in suburban neighborhoods near wooded areas with enlarging populations of deer	 which	 although not susceptible to Lyme disease	 supply the adult tick with a required blood meal	 enlarging populations of both the white-footed mouse and other small rodents (the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease) and spirochete-infected nymphal _I. scapularis_	 the primary vector for Lyme disease in the northeastern and upper Midwestern US	 and climatic conditions that favor proliferation of the tick	 mouse and deer populations.;;;;;;;;;;																
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is endemic in many parts of the UK	 particularly in woodland and heath-land areas	 and occasional cases are acquired in peri-urban parks and recreational areas with suitable habitat. In the UK	 the mean annual incidence rates for laboratory-confirmed cases have risen from 0.06 per 100	000 total population for the period 1986 to 1992	 to 0.64 cases per 100 000 total population in 2002	 to 1.1 cases per 100 000 total population in 2005 (<http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Lyme-Disease.htm#ref3>). ;;;;;;;;;;																			
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease became nationally notifiable in 1991 in the United States. The annual number of confirmed cases reported to the CDC in the United States has steadily risen	 for example	 from 17	730 cases in 2000 to nearly 30	000 in 2009	 i.e.	 an annual incidence rate of approximately 10 per 100 000 in 2009 (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html>). Much higher incidence rates are reported focally in the northeastern and upper mid-western states	 e.g.	 78 per 100 000 in the state of Connecticut in 2009 (<http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/incidencebystate.html>). ;;;;;;;;;;																	
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dogs living in endemic regions can develop Lyme disease (<http://pets.webmd.com/dogs/lyme-disease-dogs-canine-lyme-disease>). Many dogs exposed to Lyme disease do not become ill but develop serologic evidence of infection. The dominant clinical feature of Lyme disease in dogs is recurrent lameness due to inflammation of the joints. ;;;;;;;;;;

"concern -- how difficult is it to get this tested?"""" the mother said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
An Alberta Health Services spokesman said the province follows Public;;;;;;;;;;																									
Health Agency of Canada guidelines in ordering testing. The agency;;;;;;;;;;																									
states that a diagnosis should be made after evaluating both the;;;;;;;;;;																									
symptoms and the risk of exposure to infected ticks. A University of;;;;;;;;;;																									
Calgary faculty of medicine professor who studies the Lyme disease;;;;;;;;;;																									
bacteria said Alberta physicians must begin paying closer attention to;;;;;;;;;;																									
"the possibility the disease could rear up again in the province. """"A;;;;;;;;;;"																									
lot of physicians are under the impression that you can't even get;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease in Alberta. Now things are changing	 we see infected;;;;;;;;;;																								
"ticks,"""" said George Chaconas, who holds the Canada research chair in;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"Lyme disease. """"It needs to be considered a possibility by;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"physicians."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Since the province began a surveillance program in 2007	 roughly 25;;;;;;;;;;																								
ticks carrying the Lyme disease bacteria have been detected. The;;;;;;;;;;																									
infected ticks this year [2011] were found on pets in the Edmonton and;;;;;;;;;;																									
Calgary areas. From 1989 to 2008	 20 cases of human Lyme disease were;;;;;;;;;;																								
reported in Alberta. Most of the cases were linked to travel in the US;;;;;;;;;;																									
or Europe. Last year [2010]	 the province identified about a dozen;;;;;;;;;;																								
infected ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The risk of human infection in Alberta is a small one	 said Corriveau;;;;;;;;;;																								
on Tuesday [19 Jul 2011]. However	 Albertans should take steps to ward;;;;;;;;;;																								
off possible infections. Alberta authorities believe the ticks are;;;;;;;;;;																									
imported seasonally	 likely by migrating birds.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The level of concern would rise considerably if evidence surfaced the;;;;;;;;;;																									
ticks have established a home base in Alberta. That would mean they;;;;;;;;;;																									
can survive the winter	 reproduce in the spring and endure Alberta's;;;;;;;;;;																								
"typically dry climate. """"There's been no evidence of that,"""" Corriveau;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"said. """"We're using the ticks and the animals as sentinels,"""" said Dr;;;;;;;;;;"																									
Gerald Hauer	 Alberta's chief veterinarian.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Other parts of Canada	 such as southern British Columbia and Nova;;;;;;;;;;																								
Scotia	 have larger populations of the bacteria-carrying ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																								
Climate change could be a determining factor in a potential upswing of;;;;;;;;;;																									
infected tick activity in Alberta	 Chaconas contended.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The past 2 years	 for example	 have been particularly moist -- the;;;;;;;;;;																							
"type of climate in which Lyme-carrying ticks thrive. """"As conditions;;;;;;;;;;"																									
change	 ticks can move into the area and the disease does spread from;;;;;;;;;;																								
"place to place with climate change,"""" said Chaconas.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Even with the relative dearth of local tick population	 Alberta;;;;;;;;;;																								
physicians should be alert to the possibility of infection	 said;;;;;;;;;;																								
Corriveau. Apart from an initial rash	 symptoms of Lyme disease are;;;;;;;;;;																								
"very nonspecific,"""" Corriveau said. """"It could be a broad range of;;;;;;;;;;"																									
illnesses that present in similar ways. Part of raising awareness is;;;;;;;;;;																									
"making sure our physicians are aware there's a possibility."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Blood samples from suspected cases are first sent to a provincial;;;;;;;;;;																									
lab. Then	 to guard against false positive results	 the sample is sent;;;;;;;;;;																							
to a national lab in Winnipeg for further testing. Prevention is the;;;;;;;;;;																									
best defence against the disease	 Corriveau noted. Covering up;;;;;;;;;;																								
outdoors and using insect repellent help protect against the infected;;;;;;;;;;																									
ticks.;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by the spirochete;;;;;;;;;;																									
_Borrelia burgdorferi_. The infection is transmitted to humans through;;;;;;;;;;																									
the bite of the _Ixodes scapularis_ tick in eastern Canada and _Ixodes;;;;;;;;;;																									
pacificus_ in western Canada (1).;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in North;;;;;;;;;;																									
America and Europe	 but it is not common in Canada. The western;;;;;;;;;;																								
black-legged ticks (_Ixodes pacificus_) are distributed widely in;;;;;;;;;;																									
British Columbia and are well established in the lower mainland	;;;;;;;;;;																								
Fraser Valley and on Vancouver Island. The eastern black-legged ticks;;;;;;;;;;																									
(_I. scapularis_) have a more patchy distribution and are well;;;;;;;;;;																									
established in some locations in Ontario along the shores of Lake Erie;;;;;;;;;;																									
and Lake Ontario	 in southeastern Manitoba	 and in Bedford and the;;;;;;;;;;																							
Lunenburg area of Nova Scotia (1	 2). _Ixodes_ ticks are found;;;;;;;;;;																								
intermittently in most provinces in Canada	 likely brought by;;;;;;;;;;																								
migratory birds; 10 percent to 12 percent of these ticks may carry _B.;;;;;;;;;																									
burgdorferi_ (3). Therefore	 one could theoretically acquire Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																								
disease from the bite of an infected tick anywhere in Canada but the;;;;;;;;;;																									
chances are quite low	 except in areas where the eastern and western;;;;;;;;;;																								
black-legged tick populations are firmly established. Human cases of;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease in Canada are primarily the result of travel to areas;;;;;;;;;;																									
outside of Canada or areas in Canada mentioned above where infected;;;;;;;;;;																									
ticks are well established.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The incidence of Lyme disease in Canada is not known because it is;;;;;;;;;;																									
not a nationally notifiable disease	 but it is reportable in certain;;;;;;;;;;																								
provinces where the vector ticks are well established. [In 2010	 Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																								
disease became a nationally reportable disease in Canada;;;;;;;;;;																									
(<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/id-mi/lyme-fs-eng.php>).] In Ontario	;;;;;;;;;;																								
Lyme disease is a reportable disease and all cases are investigated by;;;;;;;;;;																									
public health units. Between 1999 and 2004	 a total of 172 cases of;;;;;;;;;;																								
Lyme disease were reported in Ontario	 of which 110 (64 percent) were;;;;;;;;;;																								
travel-related; only 31 (18 percent) were known to have been acquired;;;;;;;;;																									
locally (4). The number of endemic cases reported in Ontario (5 to 10;;;;;;;;;;																									
per year) has not increased over the past 2 decades.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
If a patient presents with a skin rash typical of erythema migrans;;;;;;;;;;																									
and has had exposure in a region where the black-legged tick is;;;;;;;;;;																									
established	 a diagnosis of Lyme disease should be made on clinical;;;;;;;;;;																								
grounds alone. In areas of the country where black-legged ticks have;;;;;;;;;;																									
been found but populations are not known to be established	 a;;;;;;;;;;																								
diagnosis based on clinical findings alone is more difficult. For;;;;;;;;;;																									
rashes occurring in these areas or if the rash is not typical	;;;;;;;;;;																								
laboratory confirmation is recommended. Laboratory diagnosis of Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease is accomplished based on demonstration of a serological;;;;;;;;;;																									
response to _B. burgdorferi_.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Serological testing is recommended when patients have a rash;;;;;;;;;;																									
suggestive of erythema migrans outside of the appropriate season in a;;;;;;;;;;																									
tick-established area or in an area of the country where the tick is;;;;;;;;;;																									
not established. Testing is also suggested for patients with;;;;;;;;;;																									
characteristic neurological	 cardiac	 or joint involvement with a;;;;;;;;;;																							
reasonable possibility of exposure to black-legged ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																									
Immunoglobulin M antibodies are usually detectable within weeks of the;;;;;;;;;;																									
onset of symptoms; however	 a substantial proportion of patients will;;;;;;;;;																								
not have antibodies present at the time of clinical presentation.;;;;;;;;;;																									
Therefore	 repeat testing 4 weeks after an initially negative test is;;;;;;;;;;																								
suggested. Antibody measurement by enzyme immunoassay is sensitive but;;;;;;;;;;																									
lacks specificity; therefore	 a 2-step procedure with confirmation of;;;;;;;;;																								
positive enzyme immunoassay results by Western blot is recommended;;;;;;;;;;																									
with interpretation of the Western blot results using the Centers for;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Disease Control and Prevention (USA) guidelines (8)."""";;;;;;;;;;"

Gracie was a happy and healthy 4-year-old dog who enjoyed walks and;;;;;;;;;;																									
"tearing around her yard. Then Gracie changed. """"She could hardly get up;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"from her bed. She could hardly stand,"""" [a woman] of Janesville said of;;;;;;;;;;"																									
her golden and Labrador retriever mix. Gracie continued favoring;;;;;;;;;;																									
different legs and plopping onto the floor	 causing [her owner] to;;;;;;;;;;																								
take her to a veterinarian. The diagnosis: Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is on the increase among people in Rock County	 and it's;;;;;;;;;;																								
a common diagnosis in their pets	 too. Veterinarian Terence McSweeny;;;;;;;;;;																								
of All Creatures Small Animal Hospital in Janesville said about 5;;;;;;;;;;																									
percent of the new patients he tests for Lyme disease have positive;;;;;;;;;;																									
results.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Debbie Erickson of the Rock County Health Department said Lyme cases;;;;;;;;;;																									
in the county have increased in people	 with 48 cases reported in;;;;;;;;;;																								
2010	 compared to 28 in 2009. Statewide	 Lyme disease cases totaled;;;;;;;;;;																							
3495 in 2010	 compared to 2587 in 2009	 a 35 percent increase	 the;;;;;;;;;;																						
state Department of Health Services reported.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease impacts the skin	 nervous system	 heart	 and joints. [It;;;;;;;;;;																						
is caused by bacteria that] spread through bites from infected deer;;;;;;;;;;																									
ticks. More than 20 000 cases of the disease have been reported in;;;;;;;;;;																									
Wisconsin residents since 1980	 according to the health services;;;;;;;;;;																								
department. Symptoms of Lyme disease include fever	 aches	 arthritic;;;;;;;;;;																							
pain	 and neurological problems	 Erickson said. Antibiotics are used;;;;;;;;;;																							
to treat the disease.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Most Rock County residents contract Lyme locally	 even though the;;;;;;;;;;																								
"disease is more common in northern Wisconsin, she said. """"We definitely;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"have deer ticks with Lyme in Rock County,"""" Erickson said. """"We have had;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"clients that have had pretty severe side effects from the disease."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
McSweeny said he screens pets he sees in his office. He said many;;;;;;;;;;																									
dogs with positive tests don't show symptoms [clinical signs]. He said;;;;;;;;;;																									
"the disease leads to kidney failure. """"I think it's a problem,;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"particularly in this area,"""" McSweeny said. """"I think it's very;;;;;;;;;;"																									
important from March through November to have your dog on a flea or;;;;;;;;;;																									
"tick preventative."""" People and pet owners are becoming more aware of;;;;;;;;;;"																									
the disease	 Erickson and McSweeny said.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Gracie was taken to a veterinarian the same day she showed symptoms;;;;;;;;;;																									
"[clinical signs] and was put on antibiotics, Hanson said. """"It was like;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"a miracle,"""" [her owner] said. """"The next day, she showed no signs of;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"lameness."""" She doesn't like to walk Gracie in the woods behind her;;;;;;;;;;"																									
house anymore and said that area is where she likely attracted Lyme.;;;;;;;;;;																									
Since Gracie's treatment	 she has had as much energy as ever	 the;;;;;;;;;;																							
"woman said. """"It is a happy ending,"""" she said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease occurs 3 to 30 days after the bite of an infected tick.;;;;;;;;;;																									
Symptoms in people include rash	 fever	 chills	 fatigue	 headache	;;;;;;;;;;																				
joint pain	 and swollen lymph nodes	 according to the state Department;;;;;;;;;;																							
of Health Services. The disease is treated with antibiotics.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
To reduce the chance of getting Lyme disease:;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NOM?;;;;;;;;;;																									
- Use tick repellants applied according to the label's instructions.;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NOM?;;;;;;;;;;

[Lyme disease	 due to the spirochete _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 is;;;;;;;;;;																							
distributed focally within the United States: it is considered endemic;;;;;;;;;;																									
in 8 northeastern states (Connecticut	 Delaware	 Maryland	;;;;;;;;;;																						
Massachusetts	 New Jersey	 New York	 Pennsylvania	 and Rhode Island);;;;;;;;;;																					
and 2 upper Midwestern (Wisconsin and Minnesota); 93 percent of the;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
Since Lyme disease became nationally notifiable in 1991	 the annual;;;;;;;;;;																								
number of reported cases has more than doubled. This increase is;;;;;;;;;;																									
likely the result of several factors that include: enhanced case;;;;;;;;;;																									
detection	 as well as a true increase in disease incidence due to more;;;;;;;;;;																								
people (accompanied by their pet dogs) living in suburban;;;;;;;;;;																									
neighborhoods near wooded areas that place them in proximity to;;;;;;;;;;																									
enlarging populations of deer	 which	 although not susceptible to Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																							
disease	 supply the adult tick with a required blood meal	 and;;;;;;;;;;																							
enlarging populations of the white-footed mouse and other small;;;;;;;;;;

Abstract [in 2008 post]:;;;;;;;;;;																									
-----------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
Cases of human Lyme borreliosis (LB) are registered in all;;;;;;;;;;																									
administrative regions of Ukraine and in the Autonomous Republic of;;;;;;;;;;																									
Crimea with an increasing tendency. The hard tick _Ixodes ricinus_ was;;;;;;;;;;																									
proven to be the main vector of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ s.l.	 the;;;;;;;;;;																								
causative agents of LB. We identified active natural LB foci in which;;;;;;;;;;																									
almost 25 percent of the adult _I. ricinus_ ticks contained borrelias	;;;;;;;;;;																								
and more than 30 percent of the human population were seropositive for;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme borreliae.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The role of _Mus musculus_	 _Microtus arvalis_	 _Myodes glareolus_	;;;;;;;;;;																						
_Apodemus agrarius_	 and _A. sylvaticus_ in the transmission cycle of;;;;;;;;;;																								
the LB agent(s) was revealed. Combined foci and cases of LB/TBE;;;;;;;;;;																									
(tick-borne encephalitis) mixed infection were registered in 8;;;;;;;;;;																									
oblasts. A considerable spectrum of different clinical manifestations;;;;;;;;;;																									
of LB has been found	 including erythema migrans [red patches on the;;;;;;;;;;																								
skin that move around] in 64.9 percent of cases	 neurologic symptoms;;;;;;;;;;																								
in 26.1 percent	 rheumatic affliction in 24.7 percent	 and;;;;;;;;;;																							
"cardiovascular problems in 8.3 percent."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Donetsk region is located in southeastern Ukraine with an area;;;;;;;;;;																									
that is 4.4 percent of the entire territory of Ukraine and a;;;;;;;;;;																									
population of about 4.6 million people (2006);;;;;;;;;;																									
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_Oblast>). The Donetsk region's;;;;;;;;;;																									
climate is mostly continental	 which is characterized by hot summers;;;;;;;;;;																								
and relatively cold winters. Its largest towns include Donetsk city	;;;;;;;;;;																								
Artyomovsk	 Slavyansk	 Kramatorsk	 Gorlovka	 and Makeyevka. The;;;;;;;;;;																					
regional center is Donetsk city. ;;;;;;;;;;

Last year [2010] nearly 30 000 Americans were diagnosed with Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease and Pennsylvania leads the nation in the number of confirmed;;;;;;;;;;																									
cases. According to Allegheny County Health Department spokesperson;;;;;;;;;;																									
Guillermo Cole	 the number of cases among Allegheny County residents;;;;;;;;;;																								
has been hovering in the 20-30 a year range for some time but how the;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease is being contracted is changing.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In the past	 the infections were mainly acquired on trips outside our;;;;;;;;;;																								
region but in recent years more and more infections are being acquired;;;;;;;;;;																									
"locally,"""" said Cole. He is not surprised, """"The tick that transmits;;;;;;;;;;"																									
Lyme disease	 which is the deer tick	 is now the most commonly found;;;;;;;;;;																							
"tick on people and pets here in Allegheny County."""" The Centers for;;;;;;;;;;"																									
Disease Control confirms that the illness continues to spread. In 2009;;;;;;;;;;																									
there were 4950 confirmed cases of Lyme disease in Pennsylvania.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease can usually be treated with antibiotics with the patient;;;;;;;;;;																									
suffering no long-term effects but if not treated while in its early;;;;;;;;;;																									
stages it can have lasting impacts on the central nervous system. Cole;;;;;;;;;;																									
says many people with Lyme disease originally believe they have a mild;;;;;;;;;;																									
"case of the flu until the telltale red """"bullseye"""" rash begins to;;;;;;;;;;"																									
appear.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
People usually come in contact with deer ticks while walking through;;;;;;;;;;																									
high grasses or through leaf litter. Cole says staying on paths or in;;;;;;;;;;																									
clearings will help to avoid contact with the ticks. Applying insect;;;;;;;;;;																									
repellant containing 20-30 percent DEET will also help as well as;;;;;;;;;;																									
tucking long pants into socks and wearing long sleeve shirts when;;;;;;;;;;																									
hiking through areas where the tick may live. Most Lyme cases are;;;;;;;;;;																									
reported from late May through August.;;;;;;;;;;

As the weather gets warmer	 more people have the itch to be outside.;;;;;;;;;;																								
But local health departments want you to be on the lookout for a;;;;;;;;;;																									
certain kind of bug.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Cases of Lyme disease	 which is caused by deer ticks	 are up in the;;;;;;;;;;																							
state [Wisconsin]. The number of cases statewide in 2010 rose to 2511	;;;;;;;;;;																								
up from 1948 in 2009. Locally	 both Eau Claire and Chippewa Counties;;;;;;;;;;																								
saw an increase in the number of Lyme disease cases. Eau Claire County;;;;;;;;;;																									
went from 158 cases in 2009 to 196 in 2010. The jump was even greater;;;;;;;;;;																									
in Chippewa County where 125 cases were reported in 2010; there were;;;;;;;;;																									
[only] 79 cases in 2009.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A bigger deer population	 more people living near wooded areas and;;;;;;;;;;																								
greater awareness about Lyme disease could be reasons for the higher;;;;;;;;;;																									
"numbers. """"They're coming in earlier I think or we're just seeing an;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"increase in people coming in and having us remove the tick for them,"""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
says Vicky Buhr	 a Mayo Clinic Health System nurse practitioner.;;;;;;;;;;																								
They're coming in and having the tick removed because they're afraid;;;;;;;;;;																									
"they're going to get Lyme disease."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Buhr says a tick bite will usually appear in the form of a;;;;;;;;;;																									
red-colored bullseye. The person can also have flu-like symptoms. A;;;;;;;;;;																									
blood test is then used to determine if someone has Lyme disease. [The;;;;;;;;;;																									
diagnosis of Lyme disease at the early stage of erythema migrans is;;;;;;;;;;																									
clinical	 based on the history of a tick bite in an endemic area and;;;;;;;;;;																								
"the distinctive """"bullseye"""" or target-like appearance of the skin;;;;;;;;;;"																									
lesion. A serology test for Lyme disease at this early stage of the;;;;;;;;;;																									
"disease is not the standard of care]. """"If it's done early on, you may;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"get a false negative,"""" says Buhr. """"The antibodies will typically be;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"present at 4 to 6 weeks, [when] you can get an accurate test."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Not all tick bites lead to Lyme disease. """"If the tick has been;;;;;;;;;;"																									
attached [for] greater than 72 hours	 you have about a 25 percent;;;;;;;;;;																								
"chance of developing Lyme disease,"""" says Buhr. """"Less than 72 hours you;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"have a zero to one percent chance of getting it."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Buhr says you don't need to be in high grass to get a tick bite. Some;;;;;;;;;;																									
patients have found a tick bite after mowing the lawn. If you plan on;;;;;;;;;;																									
being outdoors wear tick repellent and check for ticks often. The;;;;;;;;;;																									
greatest risk for developing Lyme disease is during June and July.;;;;;;;;;;

(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5623a1.htm>):;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and;;;;;;;;;;																									
is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected blacklegged ticks;;;;;;;;;;																									
(_Ixodes_ spp.). Early manifestations of infection include fever	;;;;;;;;;;																								
headache	 fatigue	 and a characteristic skin rash called erythema;;;;;;;;;;																							
migrans. Left untreated	 late manifestations involving the joints	;;;;;;;;;;																							
heart	 and nervous system can occur. ……..With approximately 20 000;;;;;;;;;;																								
new cases reported each year	 Lyme disease is the most common;;;;;;;;;;																								
vectorborne disease in the United States. Cases occur most commonly in;;;;;;;;;;																									
northeastern	 mid-Atlantic	 and north-central states and among persons;;;;;;;;;;																							
aged 5-14 years and 45-54 years. Cases peak during summer months	;;;;;;;;;;																								
reflecting transmission by nymphal vector ticks during May and June.;;;;;;;;;;																									
Since Lyme disease became nationally notifiable in 1991	 the annual;;;;;;;;;;																								
number of reported cases has more than doubled. This increase likely;;;;;;;;;;																									
is the result of several factors	 including a true increase in disease;;;;;;;;;;																								
incidence and enhanced case detection resulting from implementation of;;;;;;;;;;																									
"laboratory-based surveillance in several states."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Climate change	 growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding;;;;;;;;;;																								
wooded areas	 and enlarging populations of deer as well as of the;;;;;;;;;;																								
white-footed mouse and other small rodents (the primary reservoirs for;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease) are thought to be responsible for the spread of the;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease. _Ixodes scapularis_	 the primary vector for Lyme disease in;;;;;;;;;;																								
the northeastern US	 travels into new areas on wildlife and birds.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is distributed focally within the United States: it is;;;;;;;;;;																									
considered endemic in 8 northeastern states (Connecticut	 Delaware	;;;;;;;;;;																							
Maryland	 Massachusetts	 New Jersey	 New York	 Pennsylvania & Rhode;;;;;;;;;;																					
Island) and 2 upper Midwestern (Wisconsin & Minnesota); 93 percent of;;;;;;;;;																									
the total cases reported to the US CDC during 2003-2005 were reported;;;;;;;;;;																									
from these 10 states;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
For prevention of Lyme disease after a recognized tick bite	 routine;;;;;;;;;;																								
use of antimicrobial prophylaxis or serologic testing is not;;;;;;;;;;																									
recommended (E-III). A single dose of doxycycline may be offered to;;;;;;;;;;																									
adult patients (200 mg dose) and to children 8 years of age and older;;;;;;;;;;																									
(4 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) (B-I) when all of the;;;;;;;;;;																									
following circumstances exist:;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
a. the attached tick can be reliably identified as an adult or;;;;;;;;;;																									
nymphal _I. scapularis_ tick that is estimated to have been attached;;;;;;;;;;																									
for more than 36 hours on the basis of the degree of engorgement of;;;;;;;;;;																									
the tick with blood or of certainty about the time of exposure to the;;;;;;;;;;																									
tick;;;;;;;;;;																									
b. prophylaxis can be started within 72 hours of the time that the;;;;;;;;;;																									
tick was removed; ;;;;;;;;;																									
c. ecologic information indicates that the local rate of infection of;;;;;;;;;;																									
these ticks with _B. burgdorferi_ is 20 percent or greater; and;;;;;;;;;																									
d. doxycycline treatment is not contraindicated. The time limit of 72;;;;;;;;;;																									
hours is suggested because of the absence of data on the efficacy of;;;;;;;;;;																									
chemoprophylaxis for tick bites following tick removal after longer;;;;;;;;;;																									
time intervals. Infection of 20 percent or greater of ticks with _B.;;;;;;;;;;																									
burgdorferi_ generally occurs in parts of New England	 in parts of the;;;;;;;;;;																								
mid-Atlantic States	 and in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin	 but not;;;;;;;;;;																							
"in most other locations in the United States."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Erythema migrans is the only manifestation of Lyme disease in the;;;;;;;;;;																									
United States that is sufficiently distinctive to allow clinical;;;;;;;;;;																									
diagnosis in the absence of laboratory confirmation. In a patient with;;;;;;;;;;																									
a compatible epidemiologic and clinical history	 the preferred means;;;;;;;;;;																								
of diagnosis is visual inspection of the skin lesion. Serologic;;;;;;;;;;																									
testing is too insensitive in the acute phase (the 1st 2 weeks of;;;;;;;;;;																									
infection) to be helpful diagnostically…..Patients should be treated;;;;;;;;;;																									
"on the basis of clinical findings."""";;;;;;;;;;"

Tick-borne Lyme disease is being reported in areas of Massachusetts ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
where cases were considered rare 10 years ago	 health officials said. ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Once found mostly on Cape Cod and surrounding islands	 the bacterial ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease is showing up in areas across the state	 The Boston Globe ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
reported Monday [23 Aug 2010].;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Previously	 cases were largely restricted to people who had visited ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Cape Cod and suffered tick bites, the newspaper said. """"Now they're ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
living in Charlton	 they're living in Northborough	 they're living in ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Westborough [These towns are in Worcester County, Massachusetts],"""" Dr ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Richard Ellison	 hospital epidemiologist at UMass [University of ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Massachusetts] Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, said. """"And ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"they're not traveling to the Cape."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The state Department of Public Health says cases have increased ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
4-fold in Middlesex	 Norfolk	 and Worcester counties since 2000. The ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease is spreading	 experts said	 as deer populations grow and ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
human developments encroach on natural habitats. Hundreds of ticks ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
can hitch a ride on a single deer	 and one female tick can lay 2000 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
or more eggs.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"This has been an accident waiting to happen,"""" said Dr Thomas ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Treadwell	 director of an infectious disease clinic in Framingham	 ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Massachusetts. """"If you don't have the deer, you don't have the tick. ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
And if you don't have the tick	 you don't have the disease. But we ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"now have the perfect habitat here."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease causes flu-like symptoms although serious cardiac and ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
neurological complications can occur in some patients	 the Globe reported.;;;;;;;;;;

[Lyme disease is distributed focally within the United States: it is ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
considered endemic in 8 northeastern states (Connecticut	 Delaware	 ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Maryland	 Massachusetts	 New Jersey	 New York	 Pennsylvania	 and ;;;;;;;;;;																				
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Rhode Island) and 2 upper Midwestern (Wisconsin and Minnesota)	 where ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
93 percent of cases were reported during 2003-2005 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"(<<a href=""""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5623a1.htm"""">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5623a1.htm</a>>). Cases are ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
reported by county of residence	 which is assumed to be the county of ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
exposure; however	 people are often exposed to infected ticks outside ;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
their county of residence. For example	 in Massachusetts	 people can ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
be exposed to infected ticks on Cape Cod (Barnstable County) while on ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
vacation	 but they reside mid-state in Worcester County.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Climate change	 growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
wooded areas	 and enlarging populations of deer	 as well as the ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
white-footed mouse and other small rodents (the primary reservoirs ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
for Lyme disease) are thought to be responsible for the spread of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease. _Ixodes scapularis_	 the primary vector for Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease in the northeastern US	 travel into new areas on wildlife and birds.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
_I. scapularis_ transmits human granulocytic anaplasmosis	 as well as ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease and babesiosis. Because of a common tick vector	 a ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
patient infected with any one of these pathogens may be co-infected ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
with other pathogens that the tick vector may be concurrently carrying.;;;;;;;;;;

The incidence of Lyme disease [borreliosis] has increased in Russia.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The most affected area is Moscow city. However	 the specialists  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
consider that most cases of tick bites in Muscovites occur outside the  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
city's border and there is no need for tick control chemicals in the  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Moscow city parks.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Affairs and Human  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Welfare] reports that the numbers of tick-borne encephalitis and  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
borreliosis cases are significantly higher this year [2010]. The  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
incidence of both diseases was up in 2009 by 32.4 percent and 26  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
percent	 [respectively] compared with 2008 data. This underlines the  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
continuous worsening of the situation over the recent years. The area  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
of borreliosis spread is larger than that of tick-borne encephalitis.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Out of 732 tick-borne borreliosis cases in 2009 only 10 [1.4 percent]  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
were acquired within the Moscow city territory; 56 percent of cases  ;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
were acquired from Moscow oblast region	 40 percent of cases were  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
acquired from other regions of Russia	 and 2.7 percent of cases came  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
from foreign countries.;;;;;;;;;;

[Lyme disease is endemic for 72 federal administrative divisions of Russia;;;;;;;;;;

more epidemiological significance and occur from the Leningrad and Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;

regions in the west to Southern Sakhalin in the east. The natural infection;;;;;;;;;;

"A Laurieton doctor says he has """"absolute proof"""" that 2 of his ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
patients have a tick-borne disease that health authorities say does ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
not exist in Australia. GP Dr Peter Mayne said 2 of his patients had ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the bacterial illness Lyme disease. He urged medical colleagues to ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"keep an eye out for the infection. """"I've taken tissue samples at the ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
bite sites	 and sent them off for DNA analysis	 and they were ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"positive,"""" Dr Mayne said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Debate continues about whether Australian ticks can carry Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"disease. """"There are perceptions that Lyme disease doesn't exist here ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
in Australia	 and the medical profession have been lulled into ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"thinking that they don't have to worry about Lyme disease,"""" Dr Mayne ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
said.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In its later stages	 the infection can spread through the bloodstream ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
and affect the brain	 heart and joints. Earlier symptoms can include ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
a rash	 fever	 headaches	 tiredness and joint pain.;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease made headlines this month after an autopsy showed a ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Sydney man had the disease when he died. The dead man's wife planned ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
to launch a class action against NSW Health	 The Sydney Morning ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Herald reported [see;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dr Mayne said he had a list of about 30 patients -- from Newcastle to ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Coffs Harbour -- with the disease. It was """"incredibly difficult"""" to ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
diagnose	 he added.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The illness is spread by ticks carrying the Borrelia bacterium. It ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
cannot be passed between people. A NSW Health fact sheet about the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease says only some ticks can be infected and they are not found ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"in Australia. Lyme disease is """"rare or absent"""" here, the fact sheet ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
claims. There may be other similar infections here	 it says. The fact ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
sheet adds that past cases where the disease did occur here involved ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
patients who contracted it overseas. Lyme disease is common in Europe ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
and North America.;;;;;;;;;;

[Initially identified as a single species	 _B. burgdorferi_ sensu ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
lato has been separated into 3 pathogenic species that cause Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;

disease: _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto	 _B. garinii_	 and _B. ;;;;;;;;;;

"afzelii_ (<<a href=""""http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/42/3/378"""">http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/42/3/378</a>>). These ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
species differ somewhat in geographic location	 vectors	 and clinical ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
manifestations: _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is present both in the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
North America and Europe	 but it seems to be absent from Asia. _B. ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
garinii_ and _B. afielii_ are present in Europe and Asia ;;;;;;;;;;

These microorganisms are transmitted to humans by ticks of the genus ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
_Ixodes_	 the only genus of ticks shown to be competent vectors of ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease to humans. _I. scapularis_ (the deer tick) and _I. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
pacificus_ transmits Lyme disease in the United States	 _I. ricinus_ ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
(the sheep tick) in western Europe	 and _I. persulcatus_ (the taiga ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
tick) in eastern Europe and Asia. Larval and nymphal stages of these ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
ticks acquire the organism when feeding on infected reservoir hosts. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In North America	 small placental mammals are reservoir hosts.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is frequently diagnosed in humans on the basis of the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
characteristic early skin lesion erythema migrans (EM). Serologic ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
testing is commonly by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
immunoblot (Western blot) for detection of antibodies to antigens ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
from a sonicate of a particular strain of _B. burgdorferi_. However	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
serologic testing may be negative in early EM. Culture is possible	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
but the yield is low for blood	 cerebrospinal fluid	 and synovial ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
fluid; isolation of the causative organism from a punch biopsy taken ;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;

poor laboratory technique. Also borrelial DNA heterogeneity and ;;;;;;;;;;

significant sequence differences in the target gene can cause ;;;;;;;;;;

Dr. Dora Anne Mills of the Maine Center of Disease Control says 50 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
cases of Lyme disease were reported in the state in January and ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
February 2010. That's up from a 5-year average of 15 for those 2 months.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Officials told the Portland Press Herald that the warm temperatures ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
in recent months are likely to blame	 setting the stage for a ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
possible increase in ticks for the coming summer.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Maine Medical Center biologist Chuck Lubelczyk said ticks normally ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
come out in the middle of April	 when the snow is gone and the ground ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
thaws. But with the warm winter	 ticks have been active most of the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
past several months.;;;;;;;;;;

[_Borrelia burgdorferi_	 the spirochete that causes Lyme Disease	 is ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick (_Ixodes ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
scapularis_ in Maine)	 which begins to feed on a blood meal in ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
spring	 soon after the thaw. The thaw in Maine has apparently ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
occurred earlier than usual this year. A graph of selected reportable ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
diseases in Maine that displays preliminary Year-To-Date (through ;;;;;;;;;;

Lyme disease surveillance in Maine began in 1989 and the number of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease cases has increased steadily since 2000. Over the same ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
period	 incidence rates for the USA population were relatively stable ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
while rates for the entire New England region fluctuated but still ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
remained higher than those for Maine; case rates were highest for 3 ;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
southeastern	 coastal counties (York	 Lincoln	 and Knox)	 with 71.2 ;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
cases per 100 000	 56.5 per 100 000	 and 42.9 per 100 000	 respectively;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Some inland areas	 including Kennebec County	 have also experienced ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
an upsurge in reported cases	 a phenomenon that is consistent with ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
ecological studies tracking changes in deer tick (_Ixodes ;;;;;;;;;;

maintain the organisms in nature	 and as a result	 the diseases they ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
produce have a common geographic distribution in the northeastern and ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
upper Midwest USA	 where this tick is commonly found. Patients with ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
any one of the diseases transmitted by _Ixodes scapularis_ may also ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
be concurrently infected with the other diseases transmitted by this vector.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
It should be noted that cases are reported by county of residence	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
which is assumed to be the county of exposure. But people are often ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
exposed to infected ticks outside their county of residence.;;;;;;;;;;

The head sanitary doctor of Kaluga oblast reports that the epidemic ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
situation regarding Lyme disease remains unfavorable there.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There were 148 registered cases in 2009	 which equates to 14.72 cases per ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
100 000 population. The doctors consider the rise in incidence to be ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
connected to more gardening	 tourism development	 and urbanization of ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
endemic lands. Unauthorized landfills also contribute their part. Landfills ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
are feeding places for many rodents which carry ticks. All this has caused ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
an expansion of the endemic areas.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
15.7 per cent of tested ticks were found positive for Lyme disease in 2009. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
2307 tick bites were reported in 2009	 including 369 children	 comparied ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
with 1760 tick bites in 2008 (including 489 children).;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The specialists consider that the level of insecticide land treatment ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
against ticks is inadequate.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The average incidence of Lyme disease in Russia was 6.82/100 000 in 2009 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
(9686 cases). The highest incidence was registered in Ural and Northwest ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
federal okrugs [districts].;;;;;;;;;;

[Lyme disease is endemic for 72 federal administrative divisions of Russia ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
(out of 83). The area of Lyme disease spread is much wider than tickborne ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
encephalitis. The most prevalent vectors are taiga ticks (_Ixodes ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
persulcatus_) and forest ticks (_Ixodes ricinus_). The taiga ticks have ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
more epidemiological significance and occur from the Leningrad and Novgorod ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
regions in the west to Southern Sakhalin in the east. The natural infection ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
rate in ticks ranges from 3 to 90 per cent. Most infections occur in ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
working age people and in schoolchildren during forest trips and garden ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
work. - Mod.NP;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
In the USA	 the average annual rate for the 3-year 2003-5 period in 10 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
reference states where the disease is endemic is 29.2 cases per 100 000 ;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
------------------------------------------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The agent of Lyme disease	 or preferably	 Lyme borreliosis	 in the ;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
United States is _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu stricto. The ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"appellation """"sensu lato"""" has traditionally meant the entire group of ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
species that cause Lyme borreliosis	 as well as related genospecies. ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Given the opportunity	 _Ixodes scapularis_ will also feed on lizards	 ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
as they do in the southeastern US	 another region with a ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
comparatively lower prevalence of infection in the ticks than in the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
generally less hospitable regions in the northeastern US for lizards.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There is little reason to think that humans or their pets are major ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
or even minor agents in spread of the organism	 except indirectly ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
through their effects on climate	 landscapes	 and deer management practices.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The population structure of _B. burgdorferi_ indicates that the agent ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
is slowly spreading from 3 relic populations in the coastal ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
northeastern US	 an area in Wisconsin and Minnesota	 and parts of ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
northern California (2	 3). There are strains in the midwestern US ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
that do not occur in the northeastern states and vice versa. Infected ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
birds may play some role in the spread of the agent on this ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
continent	 but the effect may be greater in Europe (1). In North ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
America the contiguous spread of ticks on deer with the changing ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
climate and landscapes may [be] a larger contributor. Adult ticks	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
which have roughly twice the infection prevalence as nymphs	 feed on ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
other mammalian hosts	 which are more competent than deer as ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
reservoirs for _B. burgdorferi_.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lyme disease is not """"widespread in the United States"""". The focal ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
nature of its distribution and risk is one of the features of the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease. The great majority of Lyme borreliosis cases come from a ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
limited area in the northeastern US. There may be reports from ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
several states where transmission has not been documented	 but these ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
may be either misdiagnoses or cases acquired in other locations.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"There is no evidence that Lyme disease symptoms have been """"recognized ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"for hundreds of years"""". The 1st descriptions in the medical ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
literature date to the 1st part of the 20th century in Sweden and Austria.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lyme disease has not been documented in """"nearly every country in the ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"world"""". There are large areas of the globe where there is either no ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
or insufficient documentation of _B. burgdorferi_ or a similar ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
species. These include South America	 sub-Saharan Africa	 south and ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
southeast Asia	 and Oceania.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In my opinion	 the accompanying [ProMED moderator's] comment [in ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"ProMED post Lyme disease - USA: avian hosts <a href=""""f?p=2400:1001:837379131587525::::F2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE,F2400_P1001_ARCHIVE_NUMBER,F2400_P1001_USE_ARCHIVE:1001,20100102.0024,Y"""">20100102.0024</a>] also gave ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
unmerited prominence to notions	 based on limited or no evidence	 of ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
roles for semen	 breast milk	 and insects in transmitting the ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
infection to or among humans. This was at the expense of more ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
deserved emphasis on the most common -- by a large margin -- means of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
acquisition of _B. burgdorferi_ in the United States: the bite of an ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
infected nymphal _I. scapularis_ or _I. pacificus_ tick.;;;;;;;;;;

Abstract:;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
---------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Cases of human Lyme borreliosis (LB) are registered in all;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
administrative regions of Ukraine and in the Autonomous Republic of;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Crimea with an increasing tendency. The hard tick Ixodes ricinus was;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
proved as the main vector of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l.	 the causative;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
agents of LB. We identified active natural LB foci	 in which almost;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
25 percent of the adult I. ricinus ticks contained borrelias and more;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
than 30 percent of the human population were seropositive for Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
borreliae. The role of Mus musculus	 Microtus arvalis	 Myodes;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
glareolus	 Apodemus agrarius	 and A. sylvaticus in the transmission;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
cycle of the LB agent(s) was revealed. Combined foci and cases of;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
LB/TBE (tick-borne encephalitis) mixed infection were registered in 8;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
oblasts. A considerable spectrum of different clinical manifestations;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
of LB has been found including erythema migrans [red patches on the;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
skin that move around] in 64.9 percent of cases	 neurologic symptoms;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
in 26.1 percent	 rheumatic affliction in 24.7 percent	 and;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
cardiovascular problems in 8.3 percent.;;;;;;;;;;

Lyme disease takes wing on its spread inland;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
When the red	 red robin comes bob	 bob	 bobbin' along	 it may be ;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
throwing off ticks infected with Lyme disease. You may be just ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
walking in your yard when a tick hops on you and bites.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Robins	 blue jays	 thrushes	 wrens	 and other common birds can be ;;;;;;;;;;																					
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Yale of the disease	 according to researchers at the Yale University ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
School of Public Health in New Haven.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
That may help explain the spread of Lyme disease north from the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Connecticut coast to the state's interior	 as well as to other states ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
in New England.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
It's further proof -- if more is needed -- that blame for spreading ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease can't be pigeon-holed to 1 or 2 species.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Robins are capable of transmitting the disease,"""" said Robert ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Brinkerhoff	 a post-doctoral student at the School of Public Health ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
and lead author of a paper on the bird/Lyme connection published in ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"It makes total sense,"""" Maggie Shaw of the Newtown Tick-Borne Disease ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Task Force said Monday [28 Dec 2009]. """"Birds, coyotes, deer, bear may ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"all carry Lyme disease."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
However	 Shaw said she believes one species -- white-tailed deer -- ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"is most responsible for the perpetuation of Lyme disease. """"It's ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"because of the numbers of ticks they carry,"""" Shaw said of deer, which ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
can each carry dozens of ticks at a time.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Black-legged ticks are the insects [Ticks belong to the class ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Arachnida	 not Insecta] most responsible for spreading the bacteria ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
that causes Lyme disease. In their 3 stages of life -- larval	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
nymphal	 and adult -- these ticks must have a blood meal.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
It's long been known that white-footed mice are the ubiquitous ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
reservoirs of the Lyme bacteria in nature. When newly hatched ticks ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
feed on mice	 the ticks become infected with the bacteria. When the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
ticks then bite humans for another feeding	 the humans are infected.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Deer are especially available for the 3rd blood meal that ticks must ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
have in the fall to survive and breed.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
But Brinkerhoff of Yale said deer don't spread Lyme disease to ticks	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
and neither deer nor white-footed mice are long-distance travelers.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The researchers at Yale	 looking at records and research done in the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
past	 found at least 70 common species of birds that can carry the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
bacteria	 Brinkerhoff said.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Therefore	 he said	 the Yale research suggests that birds can carry ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the ticks -- especially larval ticks -- with them as they fly. If the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
bird is infected with the Lyme bacteria	 the bird's blood can spread ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the bacteria to the ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Kirby Stafford	 an entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Experiment Station in New Haven	 said the station did some of the 1st ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme/bird research several years ago. He said when songbirds migrate ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
north	 they're more likely to pick up tiny larval and nymphal ticks	 ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"carrying them along for a ride. """"Certain birds are reservoirs,"""" he ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"said. """"Certain birds aren't."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Shaw said along with research on how Lyme disease spreads	 she'd like ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the state Department of Public Health to spend money to teach people ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"how to avoid tick-borne infection. """"There is no statewide program in ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"place for disease prevention,"""" she said. """"To me, that's incredible."""";;;;;;;;;;"

[Lyme disease is spread by more than birds. Our society is a very ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
mobile society and one that travels with its pets. Pets are not the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
only ones capable of transporting the disease as well as its vector	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the tick. Ticks will happily hitch a ride on any warm blooded host	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
including human beings.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Furthermore Lyme has been widespread in the United States for several ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
decades. Lyme Disease has been documented in nearly every country in ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the world. While the disease was only officially named in 1987	 it ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
has been around	 the symptoms recognized for hundreds of years prior ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
to the naming of the disease.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease	 or borreliosis	 is an emerging infectious disease ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
caused by at least 3 species of bacteria belonging to the genus ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
_Borrelia_. _Borrelia burgdorferi_ Sensu Lato (2) is the main cause ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
of Lyme disease in the United States	 whereas _Borrelia afzelii_ and ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
_Borrelia garinii_ cause most European cases. The disease is named ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
after the village of Lyme	 Connecticut	 where a number of cases were ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
identified in 1975. Although Allen Steere realized in 1978 that Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease was a tick-borne disease	 the cause of the disease remained a ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
mystery until 1982	 when _B. burgdorferi_ was identified by Willy ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Burgdorfer.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is classified as a zoonosis	 as it is transmitted to ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
humans from a natural reservoir among rodents by ticks that feed on ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
both sets of hosts (3). Hard-bodied ticks of the genus _Ixodes_ are ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the main vectors of Lyme disease (1). Most infections are caused by ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
ticks in the nymphal stage	 as they are very small and may feed for ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
long periods of time undetected (3). Larval ticks are very rarely ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
infected (4). Tick bites often go unnoticed because of the small size ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
of the tick in its nymphal stage	 as well as tick secretions that ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
However	 transmission is quite rare	 with only about 1 percent of ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease; this may be due to ;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the fact that an infected tick must be attached for at least a day ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
for transmission to occur (5).;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In Europe the vector is _Ixodes ricinus_	 which is also called the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
sheep tick or castor bean tick (6). In China _Ixodes persulcatus_ ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
(the taiga tick) is probably the most important vector (7). In North ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
America	 the black-legged tick or deer tick _(Ixodes scapularis_) is ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the main vector on the east coast (4). The lone star tick (_Amblyomma ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
americanum_)	 which is found throughout the Southeastern United ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
States as far west as Texas	 is unlikely to transmit the Lyme disease ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
spirochete _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (8)	 though it may be implicated in ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
a related syndrome called southern tick-associated rash illness	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
which resembles a mild form of Lyme disease (9). On the West Coast of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the United States	 the main vector is the western black-legged tick ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
(_Ixodes pacificus_) (10). The tendency of this tick species to feed ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
predominantly on host species such as lizards that are resistant to ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Borrelia infection appears to diminish transmission of Lyme disease ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
in the West (11	 12).;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
While Lyme spirochetes have been found in insects as well as ticks ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
(13) reports of actual infectious transmission appear to be rare (14) ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme spirochetes have been found in semen (15) and breast milk (16)	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
however transmission of the spirochete by these routes is not known ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
to occur (17). Congenital transmission of Lyme disease can occur from ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
an infected mother to fetus through the placenta during pregnancy. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The risk for fetal harm is much higher in the 1st 3 months of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
pregnancy than later. Prompt antibiotic treatment almost always ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
prevents fetal harm. Pregnant Lyme-disease patients cannot be treated ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
with the 1st-choice antibiotic	 doxycycline as it is potentially ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
harmful for the fetus. Instead	 erythromycin is usually given; it is ;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
less effective against the disease but harmless for the fetus (18).;;;;;;;;;;

Abstract:;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Cases of human Lyme borreliosis (LB) are registered in all  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
administrative regions of Ukraine and in the Autonomous Republic of  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Crimea with an increasing tendency. The hard tick Ixodes ricinus was  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
proved as the main vector of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l.	 the causative  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
agents of LB. We identified active natural LB foci	 in which almost  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
25% of the adult I. ricinus ticks contained borrelias and more than  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
30% of the human population were seropositive for Lyme borreliae. The  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
role of Mus musculus	 Microtus arvalis	 Myodes glareolus	 Apodemus  ;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
agrarius	 and A. sylvaticus in the transmission cycle of the LB  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
agent(s) was revealed. Combined foci and cases of LB/TBE (tick-borne  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
encephalitis) mixed infection were registered in 8 oblasts. A  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
considerable spectrum of different clinical manifestations of LB has  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
been found including erythema migrans [red patches on the skin that  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
move around] in 64.9 percent of cases	 neurologic symptoms in 26.1  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
percent	 rheumatic affliction in 24.7 percent	 and cardiovascular  ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
problems in 8.3 percent.;;;;;;;;;;

The Department of Health said 2007 saw more than 1200 cases of Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease	 the most common tick-related illness. Normally	 the number;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
of Lyme disease cases is between 900 and 1000.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Epidemiologist Melissa Kemperman said there could be a number of;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
reasons behind the increase in the 3 diseases spread by the deer;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"tick. """"Ticks expanding into new areas, which we have documented;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
another reason could be people doing more activities in woody or;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
brushy areas	 or there could be differences in doctors suspecting and;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"diagnosing the diseases,"""" Kemperman said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease causes joint pain and inflammation and can damage the;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
heart and nervous system if left untreated. Kemperman reminds people;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
to use insect repellent when going out in the woods. It's also a good;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
idea to wear light-colored clothing to make the ticks more visible;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
and tuck pant legs into boots or socks when walking through brushy;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
areas.;;;;;;;;;;

Maine health officials report back-to-back increases in confirmed or  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
probable cases of Lyme disease in 2007 and 2008. The Maine Center for  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Disease Control and Prevention said there were more than 900 cases of  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the tick-borne illness in humans last year [2008]	 an increase of 72  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
percent. In 2007	 there was a 57 [percent] increase	 the Maine Center  ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
for Disease Control and Prevention said.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is caused by bacteria that are transmitted to humans  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
through the bite of an infected deer tick. Most common in southern and  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
coastal Maine	 Lyme disease is gradually moving up the state.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
While the disease often causes symptoms such as joint pain and  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
fatigue	 it's much more serious for some people. For some	 it brings  ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
fevers and meningitis-type symptoms. Sometimes	 it's difficult to  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"confirm a diagnosis. """"When we're fortunate and people show up and tell  ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
us that they've had a tick [bite]	 and then they get the rash and the  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
rash is an expanding red rash at the site of the bite	 that's an easy  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
diagnosis. The problem is	 most people don't remember a tick  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"attachment and not everyone gets a rash,"""" said Dr Bea Szantyr, a  ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lincoln-based physician who specializes in educating people about Lyme  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease. Gordon Smith	 director of the Maine Medical Association	 said  ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
it's not uncommon for patients to disagree with some of the treatment  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
decisions their doctors make.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Doctors had difficulty diagnosing what was wrong with a Brunswick  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
teenager after she suffered an ear infection	 105.4 deg F [40.8 deg C]  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
fever and meningitis-type symptoms	 loss of the use of the left side  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
of her body	 and swelling on the right side. [Her] family could be  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
considered a high-risk for 2 reasons: they live in Cumberland County	  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
which along with York County has the most cases of Lyme disease in  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Maine [both York and Cumberland are southeastern	 coastal counties];  ;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
and because they spend a lot of time outside on their 40-acre [16 ha]  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
farm.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
We really don't want to move. We love Maine. We just know that our  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
choices to be outside people	 farming	 and landscaping	 means we're  ;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
always going to have to keep a full-length mirror in our bathroom and  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"be like the primates and chimpanzees and pick each other for ticks,""""  ;;;;;;;;;;"

[Lyme disease is distributed focally within the United States: it is  ;;;;;;;;;;

considered endemic in 8 northeastern (Connecticut	 Delaware	 Maryland	  ;;;;;;;;;;

Massachusetts	 New Jersey	 New York	 Pennsylvania	 and Rhode Island)  ;;;;;;;;;;

Lyme disease surveillance in Maine began in 1989 and the number of  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease cases has increased steadily since 2000. Over the same  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
period	 incidence rates for the USA population were relatively stable  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
while rates for the entire New England region fluctuated but still  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
remained higher than those for Maine; case rates were highest for 3  ;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
southeastern	 coastal counties (York	 Lincoln	 and Knox)	 with 71.2  ;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
Some inland areas	 including Kennebec County	 have also experienced an  ;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
The number of reported cases of Lyme disease	 an infection transmitted by ;;;;;;;;;;																								
"the bite of deer ticks (properly called """"black-legged ticks""""), has doubled ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
in Vermont in the past 2 years. Data from the Vermont Department of Health ;;;;;;;;;;																									
show that in 2005	 29 Vermonters contracted Lyme disease from Vermont ;;;;;;;;;;																								
ticks. In 2006	 the number rose to 62. So far this year [2007]	 71 cases of ;;;;;;;;;;																							
Lyme disease in humans have been reported. The highest concentration of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
cases are in the southern part of the state -- 25 in Bennington County and ;;;;;;;;;;																									
13 in Windham County	 6 in Addison	 Chittenden and Rutland counties	 5 in ;;;;;;;;;;																						
Windsor	 2 in Franklin	 Lamoille	 Orleans and Washington counties and one ;;;;;;;;;;																						
in Caledonia and Orange counties -- and the tick season isn't over yet.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The only counties without reported cases of Lyme disease are Essex and ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Grand Isle. But that doesn't mean Lyme disease doesn't exist there	 nor ;;;;;;;;;;																								
does it mean that the people with reported cases of Lyme disease got it in ;;;;;;;;;;																									
the counties where they live. The state tracks cases by county of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
residence. That means someone who lives in Franklin County could have been ;;;;;;;;;;																									
infected on a visit to Grand Isle County	 even though Grand Isle has no ;;;;;;;;;;																								
reported cases. In fact	 Grand Isle County is known to have ticks infected ;;;;;;;;;;																								
with the Lyme bacterium. In a 2004 study	 nearly half (49 per cent) of the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
ticks collected there tested positive for the organism. In past years	 the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
Department of Health has collaborated with the Department of Agriculture	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
the Department of Forests	 Parks and Recreation and with private ;;;;;;;;;;																								
veterinarians in several tick surveillance projects. In one study	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
veterinarians reported the percentage of dogs they treated that had Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																									
antibodies. In another	 2 veterinarians from each county sent ticks they ;;;;;;;;;;																								
removed from cats and dogs to the Department of Forests	 Parks and ;;;;;;;;;;																								
Recreation	 where an entomologist categorized them according to species and ;;;;;;;;;;																								
"life stage. But Tassler noted, """"That's not really a statistically ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"representative sample."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A similar study involved collecting ticks from deer shot during the opening ;;;;;;;;;;																									
week of rifle season by combing their front ends at check stations and ;;;;;;;;;;																									
identifying the ticks by species and life-cycle stage. But	 Tassler noted	 ;;;;;;;;;;																							
"We haven't really been able to test those ticks for Lyme disease. """"We have ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
a little bit of data on what species of ticks exist in Vermont	 but we have ;;;;;;;;;;																								
very little data on what proportion of those ticks are actually carrying ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme. We don't have any funding or budget for Lyme work	 so it's just as ;;;;;;;;;;																								
"resources are available."""" The surveillance projects have been discontinued. ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
The entomologist from Forest	 Parks and Recreation who was cataloging the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
ticks just had too many other priorities	 and since the tick identification ;;;;;;;;;;																								
wasn't really in her job description	 she wasn't able to continue doing it. ;;;;;;;;;;																								
Unfortunately	 we just don't have a lot of resources in state government ;;;;;;;;;;																								
"for doing Lyme work,"""" Tassler explained. Little can be done to halt the ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
spread of ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Tassler said: Ticks travel on wildlife and birds	 and the Champlain Valley ;;;;;;;;;;																								
and Connecticut River Valley are avian flyways. The peak season for the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
onset of the disease in Vermont mirrors the peak season nationally - June ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"through August. """"That's because that time of year is when the nymphal stage ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"ticks are active,"""" Tassler said. """"And because they're so small and hard to ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
see	 people get tick bites and don't even ever realize the tick is there. ;;;;;;;;;;																								
The tick is allowed to feed for more than 24 hours which lets it transmit ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lyme disease."""" (Ticks that are attached for less than 24 hours don't have ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
time to transmit the disease.) Deer tick activity peaks again in October ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"and November, but by then most of the ticks are adults, and larger. """"People ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
tend to see them and remove them promptly	 and that's why there aren't a ;;;;;;;;;;																								
"lot of human cases that time of year,"""" Tassler said. """"The vast majority of ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"human cases of Lyme disease are caused by the nymphal-stage ticks."""" Ticks ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
are active at any temperature above 40 degrees. That means they are active ;;;;;;;;;;																									
in the fall until there have been a few hard frosts and in the early spring ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"as soon as the temperature gets above freezing. """"Ticks can be active even ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"when there's still snow on the ground,"""" Tassler said.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The best defense against Lyme disease is taking steps to prevent infection	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
Tassler argued	 and a key to prevention is doing a full body tick check ;;;;;;;;;;																								
every day. People who don't have a partner to check places like their back ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"should use a mirror. """"Once a tick gets on your body or skin, it will move ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
around until it finds a warm	 moist place to attach even if it was covered ;;;;;;;;;;																								
"up when you were outside,"""" she said. The Department of Health hopes to ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
distribute plastic cards that people can hang in their showers to remind ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"them to do daily tick checks, Tassler said. """"Even with all the other ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
prevention measures that people can take	 like insect repellent and tucking ;;;;;;;;;;																								
their pants into their socks	 you still can't always prevent all the ticks ;;;;;;;;;;																								
from getting onto you. So if you do a daily tick check and remove any ticks ;;;;;;;;;;																									
promptly before they've been attached for more than a day	 you really are ;;;;;;;;;;																								
dramatically cutting back the chances of acquiring Lyme disease. Daily tick ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"checks really can work,"""" she declared.;;;;;;;;;;"

communicated by:;;;;;;;;;;																									
ProMED-mail rapporteur Joseph P Dudley;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
[Lyme disease is distributed focally within the United States. The top 10 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
per cent of counties reported account for about 93 per cent of cases for ;;;;;;;;;;																									
which county of residence is known. These counties are located mainly in 8 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
north eastern states (Connecticut	 Delaware	 Maryland	 Massachusetts	 New ;;;;;;;;;;																					
Jersey	 New York	 Pennsylvania	 and Rhode Island). Cases are reported by ;;;;;;;;;;																						
county of residence	 which is assumed to be the county of exposure. But ;;;;;;;;;;																								
people are often exposed to infected ticks outside their county of residence.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
As indicated in the above news release	 Lyme disease peaks in the summer ;;;;;;;;;;																								
months of June	 July and August	 which correspond with the seasonal feeding ;;;;;;;;;;																							
activity of nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_ in the north eastern United States. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Because the attached nymph is about the size of a poppy seed	 it might not ;;;;;;;;;;																								
be noticed and	 therefore	 not removed before disease transmission occurs. ;;;;;;;;;;																							
Cases occurring later in the season -- for example	 in August and ;;;;;;;;;;																								
September	 occur when the adult form feeds.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Passive tick surveillance	 using ticks submitted by the public for Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																								
spirochete testing	 has been used to assess the geographical distribution ;;;;;;;;;;																								
of Lyme disease risk	 as has the use of dogs as sentinel animals for ;;;;;;;;;;																								
serology testing to characterize the risk of _B. burgdorferi_ transmission ;;;;;;;;;;																									
to humans in a defined geographical location.;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
A recent ProMED-mail posting is a reminder that Lyme disease is extremely ;;;;;;;;;;																									
common in the Baltic region. In fact	 disease rates are several fold higher ;;;;;;;;;;																								
in this area than in the USA (see graph at ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"<<a href=""""http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Lyme-Baltic.jpg"""">http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Lyme-Baltic.jpg</a>>).;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Additional background data abstracted from GIDEON (primary references ;;;;;;;;;;																									
available on request):;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The 1st cases (3) of Lyme borreliosis in Lithuania were diagnosed in 1987; ;;;;;;;;;																									
and Estonia reported its 1st cases in 1988.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Endemic foci exist in the western	 eastern	 and southern regions of ;;;;;;;;;;																							
Estonia. The areas of highest risk are concentrated along the Finnish Gulf ;;;;;;;;;;																									
coast in Harjumaa and Western Virumaa	 in Parnumaa and Eastern Virumaa ;;;;;;;;;;																								
counties	 and on the island of Saaremaa.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In Latvia	 2.7 per cent of workers in high-risk occupations and 3 per cent ;;;;;;;;;;																								
of healthy persons in the Karksi Nuia region (south) of Estonia are ;;;;;;;;;;																									
seropositive.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
_Ixodes ricinus_ is abundant in Estonia	 and _Ixodes persulcatus_ is found ;;;;;;;;;;																								
in the east and south of the country; 3 per cent of _I. ricinus_ adults and ;;;;;;;;;																									
5 per cent of the _I. persulcatus_ adults are infected with _Borrelia ;;;;;;;;;;																									
burgdorferi_; 31 per cent in Narva-Joesuu	 12 per cent in Western Virumaa	 ;;;;;;;;;																							
and 14 per cent in Tartumaa. Borreliae are found in 15 per cent of ticks ;;;;;;;;;;																									
(_I. ricinus_) on Vormsi Island. Tick infection by _B. afzelii_ and _B. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
garinii_ has also been demonstrated.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
_B. afzelii_ is the dominant species among _I. ricinus_ and _I. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
persulcatus_ in Latvia	 followed by _B. garinii_ and _B. burgdorferi_ (1993 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
to 2002). In Lithuania	 11 per cent of adults and 1 per cent of nymphal _I. ;;;;;;;;;;																								
ricinus_ ticks are infected with Borrelia (1988 to 1991).;;;;;;;;;;

way of distinguishing ixodes  from dermacentor (another common tick) is the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
absence of the characteristic festoons	 the box-like structures on the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
posterior end of the scutum	 the dorsal shield of the tick. Festoons can be ;;;;;;;;;;

A total of 12 persons have been hospitalized with tick-borne;;;;;;;;;;																									
encephalitis in the Sverdlovsky region. The number of cases of tick;;;;;;;;;;																									
bites has increased more than 2000 during the last week [up to 20;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
The press-service of territorial management of Rospotrebnadzor;;;;;;;;;;																									
(Federal Supervision Agency for Customer Protection and Human Welfare);;;;;;;;;;																									
reported that it has now treated 18 370 persons with tick bites. Of;;;;;;;;;;																									
this number 3550 are children. In comparison to the last week	 the;;;;;;;;;;																								
[cumulative] number of affected children was 3180. Currently 261;;;;;;;;;;																									
persons have been hospitalized with suspicion of tick-borne;;;;;;;;;;																									
encephalitis	 some 70 more persons than last week. The diagnosis of;;;;;;;;;;																								
tick-borne encephalitis was confirmed in 12 patients.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Such an increase in numbers of tick bites is connected to warm;;;;;;;;;;																									
[weather]	 favorable for trips in nature in the Sverdlovsk region.;;;;;;;;;;																								
However	 the danger of tick bites in parks of the city and children's;;;;;;;;;;																								
camps does not exist	 as they are treated with special acarosidal;;;;;;;;;;

According to the state	 Martha's Vineyard surpassed Nantucket in the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
number of reported cases of Lyme disease in 2005	 the most recent ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
year for which data is available.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"According to Nantucket Doctor Tim Lepore: """"A number of cases don't ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
get reported. Reporting can be fairly tiresome. You have to submit a ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
form	 then the state sends you another form to fill out	 and you have ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"to send that in. Not everyone has the time."""" Lepore said he expects ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
this tick season [2007] to be bad	 if not record-setting	 because of ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"a wet spring and the number of cases rising year after year. """"It's ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"going to be a banner year,"""" said Lepore, who could not mention Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease without stating his desire to bring back the winter deer hunt ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
aimed at thinning the heard and the disease-carrying the deer. There ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
are approximately 50 deer per square mile on the island right now	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
compared to the statewide average of 10-15 deer per square mile	 he said.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
According to the state Department of Public Health	 in 2005 there ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
were only 29 confirmed cases of Lyme disease on Nantucket	 compared ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
to 90 on Martha's Vineyard. Extrapolating those numbers for cases per ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
100 000	 Nantucket would have reported 285 cases compared to the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Vineyard's 577 cases. The state average was 36 cases per 100 000	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
according to the Department of Public Health records.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lepore said his office has already had 2 cases this year [2007]	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
which he said was early in the season	 with cases normally being ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
reported deep into July and August.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
According to the DPH	 Lyme disease	 named after the Connecticut town ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
where it was discovered	 is a bacterial infection transmitted to ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
humans through the bite of a deer tick. Symptoms include a rash at ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the site of the bite	 flu-like symptoms and sore joints. The disease ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
is treatable with a regimen of antibiotics	 but some have issues for ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
years following exposure to the bacteria.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is not the only disease carried by the ticks. Others ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
include ehrlichiosis	 which is potentially paralytic and fatal. It ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
begins with a minor paralysis and gets worse. Babesiosis is ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
malaria-like in its manifestation and can cause a very high fever. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The disease can create an enlarged liver and spleen and an extremely ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
low red blood cell count.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Cases of people contracting Lyme disease have risen nearly every year ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
in the last 15 years. According to the DPH	 in the early 1990s	 cases ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
reported in all of Massachusetts hovered around 200 until shooting up ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
in the late 1990s from 400 in 1996 to almost 1200 in 2000. In 2001	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the number was slightly above the year before	 rising to almost 2000 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
in 2002	 dropping slightly the next 2 years	 only to rise again in ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
2005 to 2200 reported cases.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Another reason Lepore said many cases of Lyme disease do not get ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
reported on Nantucket is the transient tourist population that is ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
here in the summer	 when most	 if not all	 people contract the ;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
bacterial disease. Lepore said people often get bitten here while on ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"vacation and return home before symptoms set in. """"I get calls all the ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"time from places like British Columbia, France, Switzerland,"""" said ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Lepore. """"Tick-borne diseases have an incubation period. People come ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"here for a week, get bitten and return home and then feel sick."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Deer ticks are usually no bigger than a poppy seed or a small freckle ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
on the body. If a deer tick bites a person and is engorged for more ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
than 24 hours	 chances are at least 40 percent for contracting Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease. A person can obtain one	 2 or all 3 tick-borne diseases with ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
one bite. Deer ticks are most abundant along the edges of wooded ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
areas and also feed off birds	 dogs	 cats and occasionally humans. ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The deer tick prefers the fringes of shrubby woodlands where deer are ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
plentiful	 whether near marshes	 on sand dunes or in upland fields.;;;;;;;;;;

share a common vector	 _Ixodes scapularis_	 which along with small ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
mammals	 especially the white-footed mouse	 maintain the organisms in ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
nature	 and as a result have a common geographic distribution in the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
northeastern and upper Midwest U.S.	 where this tick is commonly ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
found. Patients with any one of the diseases that is transmitted by ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
_Ixodes scapularis_ may also be concurrently infected with the other ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
diseases transmitted by this vector. Approximately 20 percent of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
patients with babesiosis are co-infected with Lyme disease	 and 6-21 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
percent of patients with anaplasmosis have serologic evidence of Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease or babesiosis.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In Europe and Asia	 the primary vectors of Lyme disease are _I. ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
ricinus_ and _I. persulcatus_	 respectively	 which also transmit ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
tick-borne encephalitis. In contrast	 the usual insect vector of ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
ehrlichiosis is _Amblyomma americanum_	 the Lone Star tick	 which	 ;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
along with the white-tailed deer	 maintains _Ehrlichiae_ in nature	 ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
which	 as a result	 are mainly found in the southeastern and ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
south-central U.S.	 where the Lone Star tick is commonly found. ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Because of different tick vectors	 patients with ehrlichiosis are ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
unlikely to be co-infected with either Lyme disease or babesiosis.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The risk of developing these infections depends upon the density of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
ticks and the animal hosts in a particular geographic location	 the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
season of the year	 and	 most importantly	 how long the tick has ;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
attached to the skin. _B. burgdorferi_ is infrequently transmitted ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
before the tick is engorged with blood after having been attached for ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
24-48 hours. Only a small percent of cases recall a tick bite	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
because of the small size of the nymphal tick	 the primary vector. ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Attached nymphal ticks might not be noticed and	 therefore	 not ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
removed before disease transmission occurs.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Deer are important for maintaining the life cycle of _I. scapularis_. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Deer supply the adult tick with a place to mate and provide a good ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
blood meal for the female adult tick	 which is necessary for ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
successful egg production. Reducing the deer population in island or ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
peninsular communities has been shown to reduce the tick densities to ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
very low levels; see;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Surveillance systems based on case report forms likely substantially ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
under-represent the true burden of these tick-borne diseases in the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
United States due to poor physician recognition and reporting. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Surveillance case definitions also may capture only those patients ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
with the specified clinical findings; patients with less severe ;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease	 for example	 may be excluded. These tick-borne diseases may ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
also be under-reported in tourist areas	 such as Nantucket or ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Martha's Vineyard	 because although the disease was acquired in these ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
localities	 patients develop symptoms several weeks later when they ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
have returned home. For example	 rates of Lyme disease	 anaplasmosis ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
and ehrlichiosis are significantly higher in Manhattan than in the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
other New York City (NYC) boroughs. This has been attributed to ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
socioeconomic factors and prevalence of travel to vacation areas ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
where the particular tick vector is prevalent. The majority of Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease (91 percent)	 HME	 and HGA cases (85 percent) reported a ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
history of travel	 compared to fewer than 50 percent of Rocky ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) cases in NYC. These data support tick ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
surveillance findings and suggest that RMSF can be acquired locally	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
while Lyme	 HME and HGE are likely acquired during travel to endemic ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
areas outside of NYC. The vector for RMSF	 _Dermacentor variabilis_ ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
(the American dog tick)	 has been detected in great abundance in all ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
boroughs of NYC; see;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease	 babesiosis	 anaplasmosis	 and ehrlichiosis can cause ;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
non-specific systemic symptoms of chills and fever during the summer. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
_B. microti_ is an intraerythrocytic parasite that results in ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
hemolytic anemia	 thrombocytopenia	 and atypical lymphocyte ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
formation; intraerythrocytic parasites (ring forms with a central ;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
pallor) and	 rarely	 pathognomonic tetrads of budding trophozoites	 ;;;;;;;;;;																						
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the so-called Maltese cross	 may be seen in Wright- or Giemsa-stained ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
peripheral blood smears. Leucopenia	 thrombocytopenia	 and elevated ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
serum transaminases occur in HME and HGA. Intracellular organisms can ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
be visualized within neutrophils in 20 to 80 percent of patients with ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
HGA	 unlike the rarity of visualizing organisms within circulating ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
mononuclear cells in HME. Serology and PCR testing are also available ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
for diagnosis. For a more detailed description of these diseases	 please see;;;;;;;;;;

During the first 5 months of 2007	 106 cases of Lyme disease were  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
reported in Estonia	 of which 40 (38 percent) were in Saaremaa.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
An epidemiologist	 Kuulo Kutsar	 from the Estonian Public Health;;;;;;;;;;																							
Service reports that 482 cases of Lyme disease occurred in Estonia;;;;;;;;;;																									
during 2006. Of these	 154 cases (32 percent) were reported from;;;;;;;;;;																								
Saaremaa	 an isolated island off the coast of Estonia. For;;;;;;;;;;																								
comparison	 during 2006	 65 cases of Lyme disease were reported from;;;;;;;;;;																							
Tallinn	 the Estonian capital	 with a population of almost 400 000.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Expert opinion attributes the outbreak in Saaremaa to the;;;;;;;;;;																									
island's isolation and an increasing contact of the island's;;;;;;;;;;																									
population with an unusually large number of ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
[Saaremaa is the largest island off the coast of Estonia	 with a;;;;;;;;;;																								
population reported to be about 40 000	 reachable from the mainland;;;;;;;;;;																								
"by ferry and air (<<a href=""""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saaremaa"""">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saaremaa</a>>). The;;;;;;;;;;"																									
population for Estonia	 as a whole	 is reported to be 1.3 million;;;;;;;;;;																							
people. For a map of this area see;;;;;;;;;;																									
"<<a href=""""http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/baltic.pdf"""">http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/baltic.pdf</a>>.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The annual incidence rate of Lyme disease for Saaremaa. in 2006	 was;;;;;;;;;;																								
385 new cases per 100 000 population for Tallinn	 or 16.3 per 100 000;;;;;;;;;;																								
and 30.6 per 100 000 for the rest of Estonia (population 860 000).;;;;;;;;;;																									
For comparison	 the annual incidence of Lyme disease in the USA;;;;;;;;;;																								
during 2003-2005	 was 29.2 per 100 000 population in 10 reference;;;;;;;;;;																								
states where the disease is endemic (Connecticut	 Delaware	 Maryland	;;;;;;;;;;																						
Massachusetts	 Minnesota	 New Jersey	 New York	 Pennsylvania	 Rhode;;;;;;;;;;																				
Island	 and Wisconsin).;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
No description of the clinical manifestations is given for the cases;;;;;;;;;;																									
in Saaremaa	 that is	 erythema migrans or late manifestations;;;;;;;;;;																							
(musculoskeletal	 cardiovascular	 or neurological)	 or whether the;;;;;;;;;;																						
number of cases was due to laboratory-based reporting	 without;;;;;;;;;;																								
adequate clinical documentation. The report also does not state the;;;;;;;;;;																									
prior annual incidence of Lyme disease in Saaremaa	 although it;;;;;;;;;;																								
characterizes the recent numbers as an outbreak -- which it would;;;;;;;;;;																									
appear to be. Neither does the report state any recent enhancement in;;;;;;;;;;																									
case detection or change in reporting methods to account for the;;;;;;;;;;																									
large number of cases in 2006 and early 2007. However	 last year;;;;;;;;;;																								
-2006	 increased Lyme disease was observed in regions of Russia;;;;;;;;;;																								
adjacent to Estonia	 and increased tick activity noted in regions of;;;;;;;;;;																								
Russia	 Latvia	 and Estonia (see below). - Mod.ML];;;;;;;;;;

Russia: South Urals prepare for tick encephalitis season;;;;;;;;;;																									
-----------------------------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
Anatoly Semenov	 the chief health officer of the Chelyabinsk region ;;;;;;;;;;																								
(Oblast) has signed a document implementing urgent measures for ;;;;;;;;;;																									
prophylaxis of tick-borne encephalitis. In previous years	 the 1st ;;;;;;;;;;																								
tick bites in the South Urals were recorded in March	 after the 1st ;;;;;;;;;;																								
spring thaws. The Chelyabinsk Territorial Management of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Rospotrebnadzor [The Federal Service for Surveillance of Consumer ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Rights and Human Welfare - Mod.NP] informed a Novie Region Agency ;;;;;;;;;;																									
correspondent that almost 18 000 inhabitants of the South Urals ;;;;;;;;;;																									
experienced tick bites in 2006. A total of 126 cases of tick-borne ;;;;;;;;;;																									
encephalitis	 including 3 fatalities	 as well as 260 cases of Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																							
disease were recorded last year [2006] in the South Urals. Overall	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
the level of morbidity from tick-borne infections in the South Urals ;;;;;;;;;;																									
was 1.5-fold greater than elsewhere in Russia. The highest morbidity ;;;;;;;;;;																									
was recorded in the Kunashakskiy	 Uiskiy	 Nazepetrovskiy and ;;;;;;;;;;																							
Nagajbakskiy districts	 and also in Plast and Karabash. Almost 28 per ;;;;;;;;;;																								
cent of those affected received their tick-bites in residential areas ;;;;;;;;;;																									
of cities and villages	 a circumstance that is causing alarm. ;;;;;;;;;;																								
Rospotrebnadzor has explained this development as the consequence of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
low uptake by the population of preventative vaccine. In 2006	 only 6 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
percent of inhabitants of the South Urals were vaccinated.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Anatoly Semenov recommended that the heads of municipalities should ;;;;;;;;;;																									
provide vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis for people ;;;;;;;;;;																									
working in forests and woodland areas and also supply them with ;;;;;;;;;;																									
protective clothing and repellents. Children and teenagers who have ;;;;;;;;;;																									
not been vaccinated should not be permitted to participate in hiking	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
excursions and ecological activities. Likewise	 a similar restriction ;;;;;;;;;;																								
should be considered by those organizing outdoor activities and ;;;;;;;;;;																									
holidays for other groups during the May to July period in the coming year.;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
[Last year (2006)	 increased tick activity was observed in a several ;;;;;;;;;;																								
regions in Russia (Pskov	 Kemerovo	 Chita	 Nizhniy Novgorod	 ;;;;;;;;;;																					
Novosibirsk	 Tyumen	 Irkutsk	 republics: Khakassia	 Buryatiya and ;;;;;;;;;;																					
Mariy El)	 and also in Latvia and Estonia. In total	 3510 cases ;;;;;;;;;;																							
(morbidity 2.44 per 100 000 inhabitants) of tick-borne encephalitis ;;;;;;;;;;																									
were registered in Russia in 2006. That is 22.7 percent less than in 2005.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In the same year [2006]	 Lyme disease was registered in 7451 persons ;;;;;;;;;;																								
(morbidity 5.18 per 100 000 inhabitants)	 which is 0.3 percent less ;;;;;;;;;;																								
"than in 2005;"" see <<a href=""""""""http://www.fcgsen.ru/"""""""">http://www.fcgsen.ru/</a>>."";;;;;;;;;"

The Chelyabinsk (South Ural) region is in the centre of Russia at the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
border of Europe and Asia	 at the southern foothills of the Ural ;;;;;;;;;;																								
mountains and the adjoining plain. In the north	 the Chelyabinsk ;;;;;;;;;;																								
region borders the Sverdlovsk region	 in the east the Kurgan region; ;;;;;;;;;																								
it also has borders with the Orenburg region in the south and with ;;;;;;;;;;																									
the Republic of Bashkortostan in the west. The southeastern part of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
the region borders the Republic of Kazakhstan. - Mod.NP];;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and;;;;;;;;;;																									
is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected blacklegged ticks;;;;;;;;;;																									
(_Ixodes_ spp.). Early manifestations of infection include fever	;;;;;;;;;;																								
headache	 fatigue	 and a characteristic skin rash called erythema;;;;;;;;;;																							
migrans. Left untreated	 late manifestations involving the joints	;;;;;;;;;;																							
heart	 and nervous system can occur. A 'Healthy People 2010';;;;;;;;;;																								
objective (14-8) is to reduce the annual incidence of Lyme disease to;;;;;;;;;;																									
9.7 new cases per 100 000 population in 10 reference states where the;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease is endemic (Connecticut	 Delaware	 Maryland	 Massachusetts	;;;;;;;;;;																					
Minnesota	 New Jersey	 New York	 Pennsylvania	 Rhode Island	 and;;;;;;;;;;																				
Wisconsin) (1). This report summarizes surveillance data for 64 382;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease cases reported to CDC (US Centers for Disease Control;;;;;;;;;;																									
and Prevention) during 2003-2005	 of which 59 770 cases (93 percent);;;;;;;;;;																								
were reported from the 10 reference states. The average annual rate;;;;;;;;;;																									
in these 10 reference states for the 3-year period (29.2 cases per;;;;;;;;;;																									
100 000 population) was approximately 3 times the 'Healthy People;;;;;;;;;;																									
2010' target. Persons living in Lyme disease -- endemic areas can;;;;;;;;;;																									
take steps to reduce their risk for infection	 including daily;;;;;;;;;;																								
self-examination for ticks	 selective use of acaricides and tick;;;;;;;;;;																								
repellents	 use of landscaping practices that reduce tick populations;;;;;;;;;;																								
in yards and play areas	 and avoidance of tick-infested areas.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
For surveillance purposes	 a reportable case of Lyme disease is defined as;;;;;;;;;;																								
1. physician-diagnosed erythema migrans equal to or greater than 5 cm;;;;;;;;;;																									
[about 2 in] in diameter or;;;;;;;;;;																									
2. at least one objective late manifestation (that is	;;;;;;;;;;																								
musculoskeletal	 cardiovascular	 or neurological) with laboratory;;;;;;;;;;																							
evidence of infection with _B. burgdorferi_ in a person with possible;;;;;;;;;;																									
exposure to infected ticks (2).;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
This surveillance case definition was developed for national;;;;;;;;;;																									
reporting of Lyme disease; it is not intended to be used in clinical;;;;;;;;;																									
diagnosis (2). For this report	 annual Lyme disease rates in 2003	;;;;;;;;;;																							
2004	 and 2005 were calculated by county	 state	 and age group	 using;;;;;;;;;;																					
reported cases and midyear U.S. Census population estimates for each;;;;;;;;;;																									
year. To limit reporting bias	 analysis of symptom data was;;;;;;;;;;																								
restricted to 6 of the 10 reference states where 90 percent or more;;;;;;;;;;																									
records included symptom information.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
During 2003-2005	 CDC received reports of 64 382 Lyme disease cases;;;;;;;;;;																								
from 46 states and the District of Columbia; 93 percent of cases;;;;;;;;;																									
occurred among residents of the 10 'Healthy People 2010' reference;;;;;;;;;;																									
states (Table	 Figure 1) [for figure	 see original URL. - Mod.ML].;;;;;;;;;;																							
The average annual rate in these 10 reference states for the 3-year;;;;;;;;;;																									
period was 29.2 cases per 100 000 population: 29.1 in 2003	 26.8 in;;;;;;;;;;																								
2004	 and 31.6 in 2005. During 2003-2005	 3 counties had annual rates;;;;;;;;;;																							
above 300 cases per 100 000 population in all 3 years: Columbia and;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dutchess counties in New York and Dukes County in Massachusetts.;;;;;;;;;;																									
Information on patient age and sex was available for 62 206 (97;;;;;;;;;;																									
percent) of reported cases. Median age of patients was 41 years	 and;;;;;;;;;;																								
patient ages followed a bimodal distribution (Figure 2). Males;;;;;;;;;;																									
accounted for 54 percent of reported cases overall and 61 percent of;;;;;;;;;;																									
cases among children aged 5-14 years. Records for 31 961 (50 percent);;;;;;;;;;																									
cases specified the race of the patient; 97 percent were identified;;;;;;;;;																									
as white	 2 percent as black	 and less than 1 percent as;;;;;;;;;;																							
Asian/Pacific Islander or American Indian/Alaska Native.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Reported date of illness onset was available for 49 157 (76 percent);;;;;;;;;;																									
case reports during 2003-2005. Patients were most likely to have;;;;;;;;;;																									
illness onset in May (7 percent)	 June (25 percent)	 July (29;;;;;;;;;;																							
percent)	 or August (13 percent); fewer than 8 percent were reported;;;;;;;;;																								
with illness onset during the period December-March. Records for 32;;;;;;;;;;																									
095 (50 percent) patients met the criteria for evaluation of;;;;;;;;;;																									
symptoms. A history of erythema migrans was reported for 70 percent;;;;;;;;;;																									
of these patients	 arthritis for 30 percent	 facial palsy for 8;;;;;;;;;;																							
percent	 radiculopathy for 3 percent	 meningitis or encephalitis for;;;;;;;;;;																							
2 percent	 and heart block for less than 1 percent.;;;;;;;;;;

Editorial note;;;;;;;;;;																									
--------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
With approximately 20 000 new cases reported each year	 Lyme disease;;;;;;;;;;																								
is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. Cases;;;;;;;;;;																									
occur most commonly in northeastern	 mid-Atlantic	 and north-central;;;;;;;;;;																							
states and among persons aged 5-14 years and 45-54 years. Cases peak;;;;;;;;;;																									
during summer months	 reflecting transmission by nymphal vector ticks;;;;;;;;;;																								
during May and June.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Since Lyme disease became nationally notifiable in 1991	 the annual;;;;;;;;;;																								
number of reported cases has more than doubled. This increase likely;;;;;;;;;;																									
is the result of several factors	 including a true increase in;;;;;;;;;;																								
disease incidence and enhanced case detection resulting from;;;;;;;;;;																									
implementation of laboratory-based surveillance in several states.;;;;;;;;;;																									
The growing number of case reports and the labor required for;;;;;;;;;;																									
confirmation of laboratory-reported cases has placed considerable;;;;;;;;;;																									
burden on local and state health departments in areas where Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease is endemic. To address this surveillance burden and create;;;;;;;;;;																									
more sustainable Lyme disease surveillance systems	 some states have;;;;;;;;;;																								
modified components of their systems	 leading to acute reductions in;;;;;;;;;;																								
reported cases (3). However	 no evidence exists to suggest a true;;;;;;;;;;																								
decrease in Lyme disease incidence in these states.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations:;;;;;;;;;;																									
1. Lyme disease surveillance is complicated by both underreporting;;;;;;;;;;																									
and overdiagnosis of cases (4	5).;;;;;;;;;;																								
2. differences in patient demographics (such as	 age and sex) among;;;;;;;;;;																								
states with above-average and below-average incidence suggest;;;;;;;;;;																									
variation in diagnostic and reporting practices among states (6).;;;;;;;;;;																									
3. clinical information on symptoms is not verified independently and;;;;;;;;;;																									
often is incomplete.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The 'Healthy People 2010' target (1) was derived from a baseline of;;;;;;;;;;																									
17.4 cases per 100 000 population reported to CDC during 1992-1996;;;;;;;;;;																									
and was established in anticipation of widespread use of a Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease vaccine	 licensed in 1999. However	 the vaccine was withdrawn;;;;;;;;;;																							
from the market in 2002	 reportedly because of poor sales (7).;;;;;;;;;;																								
Although no Lyme disease vaccine is available	 persons can lower;;;;;;;;;;																								
their risk for the disease and other tickborne illnesses by avoiding;;;;;;;;;;																									
tick-infested areas when possible	 using insect repellents containing;;;;;;;;;;																								
DEET (N	N-diethyl-m-toluamide)	 and performing daily self-examination;;;;;;;;;;																							
for ticks (7). In North America	 removing ticks within 24 hours of;;;;;;;;;;																								
attachment reduces the likelihood of _B. burgdorferi_ transmission;;;;;;;;;;																									
(8). Tick populations around homes and in recreational areas can be;;;;;;;;;;																									
reduced 50 to 90 percent through simple landscaping practices such as;;;;;;;;;;																									
removing brush and leaf litter or creating a buffer zone of wood;;;;;;;;;;																									
chips or gravel between forest and lawn or recreational areas. For;;;;;;;;;;																									
persons who are infected	 prompt diagnosis and treatment are;;;;;;;;;;																								
important to prevent serious illness and long-term complications;;;;;;;;;;																									
(9	10). Detailed information regarding Lyme disease prevention is;;;;;;;;;;

[The diagnosis of Lyme diseases relies on both clinical and laboratory  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
findings. For surveillance purposes	 the CDC defines a reportable case  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
of Lyme disease as;;;;;;;;;;																									
1. physician-diagnosed erythema migrans equal to or greater than 5 cm  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
[about 2 in] in diameter or;;;;;;;;;;																									
2. at least one objective late manifestation (that is	  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
musculoskeletal	 cardiovascular	 or neurological) with laboratory  ;;;;;;;;;;																							
evidence of infection with _B. burgdorferi_ in a person with possible  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
exposure to infected ticks.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The CDC report suggests that some of the increase in annual number of  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
reported cases is due to a true increase in disease incidence and  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
better case detection resulting from implementation of  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
laboratory-based surveillance. However	 differences in patient  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
demographics reported by CDC among states with above-average and  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
below-average incidence also suggest variable diagnostic and reporting  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
practices among states (CDC. Lyme Disease-United States	 2001-2002.  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
MMWR 2004; 53: 365-9).;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Inappropriate serologic testing is frequently performed in patients  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
without clinical indications of Lyme disease (Nachamkin I	 et al:  ;;;;;;;;;;

Over-reliance on serologic tests	 with reported specificities that  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
range from about 70 to 100 percent	 in patients with vague	  ;;;;;;;;;;																							
non-specific symptoms	 can result in over-diagnosis (Schoen RT	 Reid  ;;;;;;;;;;

Lyme disease has arrived for the summer in Michigan's Berrien	 Cass	 ;;;;;;;;;;																							
and Van Buren counties	 district health officials said Fri	 30 May ;;;;;;;;;;																							
2003.  The only area in Michigan where Lyme disease had been found ;;;;;;;;;;																									
was in southern Menominee County in the Upper Peninsula near ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Wisconsin. But testing by Michigan State University through tick and ;;;;;;;;;;																									
rodent surveys has discovered the disease in the 3 counties along ;;;;;;;;;;																									
with Allegan County	 said Dr. John Spriegel	 medical director with ;;;;;;;;;;																							
the Van Buren/Cass County District Health Department and deputy ;;;;;;;;;;																									
medical director with the Berrien County Health Department.  It has ;;;;;;;;;;																									
also been found in northwest Indiana.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The carrier in southwestern Michigan is the black-legged tick	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
formerly [and still commonly - Mod. LL] known as the deer tick. Of 52 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
sites checked in a 5-county area	 including in St. Joseph and Allegan ;;;;;;;;;;																								
counties	 10 have shown signs of infection in the ticks.  The sites ;;;;;;;;;;																								
where the disease-carrying ticks have been primarily found are along ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lake Michigan	 although Spriegel said 2 locations inland have also ;;;;;;;;;;																								
tested positive.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease is caused by a bacterium (_Borrelia burgdorferi_) ;;;;;;;;;;																									
transmitted by the black-legged tick. The tick is found in high ;;;;;;;;;;																									
grassy areas	 open fields	 and in woods containing thick shrubs and ;;;;;;;;;;																							
plants at ground level.  The most common tick found in Michiana [A ;;;;;;;;;;																									
term referring to the northern portion of Indiana and southwestern ;;;;;;;;;;																									
portion of Michigan.] is the American dog tick	 which is not a vector ;;;;;;;;;;																								
of Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;

"<<a href=""""mailto:promed@promedmail.org"""">promed@promedmail.org</a>>;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
[_Ixodes scapularis_	 the black-legged tick or deer tick	 is a member ;;;;;;;;;;																							
of the hard tick family (family Ixodidae). Hard ticks get their name ;;;;;;;;;;																									
from the hard plate on top of the body. They hold their mouthparts ;;;;;;;;;;																									
forward	 unlike soft ticks	 whose mouthparts are attached underneath ;;;;;;;;;;																							
"at the front. Most hard ticks are 1/16-1/8"""" (2-4 mm) long. They feed ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
on 2 or 3 hosts	 in contrast to soft ticks	 which parasitize only 1 ;;;;;;;;;;																							
host. Males of certain species do not feed. The female lays many eggs ;;;;;;;;;;																									
and dies.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
This finding of the organism in the tick vector does not necessarily ;;;;;;;;;;																									
suggest that	 at this point	 human cases of Lyme borreliosis have ;;;;;;;;;;																							
occurred.  As the density of infected ticks increases	 especially in ;;;;;;;;;;																								
areas where a human population inhabits	 works	 or plays	 the human ;;;;;;;;;;																						
disease will become manifest. - Mod.LL];;;;;;;;;;

almost 2-fold this year. A total of 156 cases have been registered so ;;;;;;;;;;																									
far this year [2006] compared with 81 last year. Most of the cases ;;;;;;;;;;																									
(69) have been reported from the Pskov Region; 14 in the Nevelisk ;;;;;;;;;

[This year's increase in tick activity has been observed in a several ;;;;;;;;;;																									
regions of Russia (the Republics of Khakassia and Buryatiya	 Irkutsk	 ;;;;;;;;;;																							
Sverdlovsk	 Pskov and other regions). It is necessary to increase the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
areas receiving anti-tick treatment: woods	 parks and communal ;;;;;;;;;;																								
gardens. For prevention of spring outbreaks of tick activity	 it is ;;;;;;;;;;																								
necessary to undertake anti-tick treatment now	 in the autumn	 and to ;;;;;;;;;;																							
repeat it in the spring.  This means insecticide spraying with ;;;;;;;;;;																									
sulfur	 various derivatives of sulfur (colloidal sulfur	 limy ;;;;;;;;;;																							
sulfuric broth and organic derivatives of sulfur)	 chlorine	 and ;;;;;;;;;;																							
organic phosphorus compounds.;;;;;;;;;;

surrounding the Baltic Sea. On the west it borders Estonia and ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Latvia	 to the south Belarus	 to the north the Leningrad region	 and ;;;;;;;;;;																						
to the east with the regions of Novgorod and Tver.  Its population ;;;;;;;;;;																									
numbers over 840 000. The region covers more than 55 000 sq. km. - Mod.NP];;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
I suspect one needs to look at the veterinary literature and pursue	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
in the differential diagnosis	 tick paralysis.  This condition has ;;;;;;;;;;																								
been known for 100 years in dogs and	 although a similar syndrome ;;;;;;;;;;																								
appears in Lyme disease	 it isn't Lyme disease and it is caused by a ;;;;;;;;;;																								
neurotoxin in the salivary glands of the tick.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
This paralysis takes many forms	 and one is the type described here ;;;;;;;;;;																								
for humans	 although rare in the dog.  I submit that the antibiotic ;;;;;;;;;;																								
"therapeutic response may be a """"red herring"""" since tick removal, ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
including the head	 results in reversal of signs and symptoms.  If ;;;;;;;;;;																								
the head of the tick is not removed and is not expelled within 48 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
hours	 the neurotoxin is still secreted into the subcutaneous tissue	 ;;;;;;;;;;																							
and the condition remains for that long.  There does seem to be a ;;;;;;;;;;																									
variant appearing in dogs that lasts clinically for 48 to 72 hours ;;;;;;;;;;																									
before the animal is able to function fairly normally.  It is worth ;;;;;;;;;;																									
considering.;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
[ProMED thanks Dr. Stevens for his comments.  Tick paralysis in ;;;;;;;;;;																									
humans tends to be a progressive ascending paralysis that may ;;;;;;;;;;																									
continue to worsen transiently after the tick is removed	 prior to ;;;;;;;;;;																								
improvement (1). Cerebellar ataxia may also be a presenting feature ;;;;;;;;;;																									
(2).  From the description of the symptoms	 the length of the illness ;;;;;;;;;;																								
seems too long to be tick paralysis	 and there are no descriptions of ;;;;;;;;;;																								
retained ticks and no frank paresis.;;;;;;;;;;

Mysterious tick disease afflicts Montana;;;;;;;;;;																									
-------------------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
Scientists believe an undiscovered Lyme disease-like illness is being ;;;;;;;;;;																									
transmitted by wood ticks in Montana	 particularly in the Yellowstone ;;;;;;;;;;																								
River area from Livingston downstream to Forsyth.  The bulls-eye ;;;;;;;;;;																									
rash	 fever	 body aches	 and lingering exhaustion caused by the ;;;;;;;;;;																						
illness have stumped doctors for at least a decade	 said State ;;;;;;;;;;																								
Epidemiologist Todd Damrow. Local	 state	 and federal scientists are ;;;;;;;;;;																							
now launching an effort to crack the mystery.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We could have a new disease here, we just don't know right now,"""" ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"Damrow said. """"We don't know how prevalent it is, how pervasive, or ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
even the nature of the illness. Those are questions we need to ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"address."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The state receives a """"handful"""" of reports each year of unexplainable ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
illnesses believed to be caused by a tick bite	 Damrow said. The ;;;;;;;;;;																								
cases have been clustered in the Yellowstone River drainage	 but ;;;;;;;;;;																								
reports have also come in from both Helena and Missoula. In each ;;;;;;;;;;																									
instance	 Lyme disease has been ruled out	 as has Rocky Mountain ;;;;;;;;;;																							
Spotted Fever.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"As far as we can tell, these cases are fairly uncommon,"""" Damrow ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"said. """"We don't think it's a large epidemic, but you never know. ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"We've never followed it."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Antibiotics have been used successfully to treat recent cases ;;;;;;;;;;																									
reported to the state. Damrow doesn't know whether the illness has ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"ever caused any deaths. """"We've never looked. We have no way of ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
knowing. Even if someone died from it	 the cause wouldn't show up on ;;;;;;;;;;																								
"the death certificate. There's no test for it,"""" he said. """"We also ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
have no idea whether	 like Lyme disease	 there are serious long-term ;;;;;;;;;;																							
"consequences."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A Former Yellowstone County Commissioner developed symptoms of the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
illness 2 years ago	 shortly after his wife spotted a tiny 8-legged ;;;;;;;;;;																								
tick on his lower back. She plucked the tick off with a tweezers	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
sealed it in a pill bottle and stashed the bottle in the freezer. A ;;;;;;;;;;																									
few days later	 he began feeling like he had the flu. The next ;;;;;;;;;;																								
morning	 a red rash the size of a silver dollar surrounded the bite. ;;;;;;;;;;																								
He immediately went to see his physician. Lyme disease was suspected ;;;;;;;;;;																									
and the tick sent off to Helena for testing.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
[Though an] active person	 after being bitten	 the patient struggled ;;;;;;;;;;																							
"to find the energy to do basic tasks. """"It felt like someone pulled ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"the plug and I was 2 quarts low,"""" he said. It was even worse not ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
knowing what was wrong.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Although the microorganism that causes Lyme disease -- _Borrelia ;;;;;;;;;;																									
burgdorferi_ -- was named after a Montana scientist	 Willy ;;;;;;;;;;																								
Burgdorfer	 Montana is the only state in the nation where a case of ;;;;;;;;;;																								
the disease has not been confirmed. The species of tick [_Ixodes ;;;;;;;;;;																									
scapularis_ - Mod.LL] that carries Lyme disease also has never been ;;;;;;;;;;																									
found in Montana.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
State officials	 including Damrow	 were convinced the patient was ;;;;;;;;;;																							
suffering from Lyme disease and had contracted it during a recent ;;;;;;;;;;																									
visit to California. He insisted	 however	 he never did anything ;;;;;;;;;;																							
during his brief stay to put him in contact with ticks. He maintained ;;;;;;;;;;																									
the tick came from his heavily wooded 54-acre property south of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Billings. Ticks are common in the area	 he said. Tests came back ;;;;;;;;;;																								
negative for Lyme disease. The tick was then shipped to the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Vector-Borne Disease Unit of the Centers for Disease Control in Fort ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Collins	 Colorado	 USA;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Meanwhile	 the patient was put on antibiotics. His physician ;;;;;;;;;;																								
continued searching for answers. This wasn't the first time she had a ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"patient with unexplainable Lyme disease-like symptoms, She said. """"I ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
think most of the physicians who practice in Montana have seen cases ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"like this."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
5 months later	 results came back from the CDC.  Experimental DNA ;;;;;;;;;;																								
analysis was used to search the gut contents of the tick	 but nothing ;;;;;;;;;;																								
conclusive could be found	 according to the report. The tick was ;;;;;;;;;;																								
identified as a Rocky Mountain wood tick [_Dermacentor andersoni_ - ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Mod.LL]	 a species common to Montana and one that does not carry Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																								
disease. The affliction could not be identified	 the report concluded.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Whatever it was, the disease no longer bothers the patient. """"I've had ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"no ill-effects since they put me on medication,"""" he said.  His ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
physician hopes the new investigation will identify the source of the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease and	 eventually	 lead to a test and a treatment. There have ;;;;;;;;;;																							
been too many unexplained cases to shrug off	 she said.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"I do think there's something to this,"""" she said. """"I'm glad they're ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"getting fired up over this."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Rocky Mountain Laboratory in Hamilton will help state and local ;;;;;;;;;;																									
officials study suspected disease-bearing ticks. The federal lab was ;;;;;;;;;;																									
founded in 1928 to study Rocky Mountain spotted fever	 a tick-borne ;;;;;;;;;;																								
illness that killed hundreds of settlers in Western Montana. In the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
early 1980s	 the lab also identified the spiral-shaped bacteria that ;;;;;;;;;;																								
causes Lyme disease. The lab's specialized equipment will play a ;;;;;;;;;;																									
vital role in finding the culprit behind Montana's mysterious ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"tick-borne illness. Damrow said he """"strongly suspects"""" a cousin of ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
the Lyme disease-causing bacteria has adapted to Montana's tick ;;;;;;;;;;																									
population.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Unless we look, we'll never know,"""" he said. """"Who knows how much ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"health we could be protecting?"""";;;;;;;;;;"

[As late as the most current report from the CDC regarding Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease in the USA (1)	 Montana was the only state in the USA without ;;;;;;;;;;																								
a single reported case of Lyme borreliosis.  The above posting	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
however	 suggests that an illness not unlike Lyme disease	 with ;;;;;;;;;;																							
regards at least to early manifestations	 is occurring in Montana and ;;;;;;;;;;																								
transmitted by the wood tick.  No etiology has been found for these ;;;;;;;;;;																									
illnesses	 which are not due to _B. burgdorferi_.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
It is important to note that a similar set of circumstances occurred ;;;;;;;;;;																									
in the southeastern part of the USA in the late 1990s where erythema ;;;;;;;;;;																									
migrans lesions and associated clinical symptoms were described	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
summarized in reference 2. Though the illnesses were consistent with ;;;;;;;;;;																									
the early stage of Lyme disease	 the majority of cases could not be ;;;;;;;;;;																								
confirmed using available methodology.  Spirochetal-appearing ;;;;;;;;;;																									
organisms were visualized in some of the skin lesions.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Postulated etiologies included a genetically variable strain of _B. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
burgdorferi_	 another _Borrelia_ species	 or an uncharacterized ;;;;;;;;;;																							
agent. The illnesses appeared to respond to antimicrobial therapy. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
The etiologies of these illnesses were discussed in an accompanying ;;;;;;;;;;																									
editorial (3) as well as a 1996 article by Barbour (4).;;;;;;;;;;

Nova Scotia's first case of Lyme disease;;;;;;;;;;																									
----------------------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
Health officials have confirmed the first case of Lyme disease in Nova ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Scotia. The provincial health department said on Friday that a person ;;;;;;;;;;																									
living on the province's South Shore contracted the disease	 which is ;;;;;;;;;;																								
caused by tick bites.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The risk of Lyme disease is still very low,"""" said Dr Richard Gould, a ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"provincial health officer. """"It is highly treatable and the public should ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"not be worried."""" The patient is recovering and [like most Lyme disease ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
patients - Mod.LL] did not require hospital admission.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Gould said the discovery of the disease in Nova Scotia was not unexpected ;;;;;;;;;;																									
because it has been present in the eastern United States for years	 and the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
tick most closely associated with the disease [as well as the usual ;;;;;;;;;;																									
vertebrate reservoirs - Mod.LL] are present in the province.;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Another comment on the vagaries of underreporting. My medical practice is ;;;;;;;;;;																									
located in Mansfield (Storrs)	 CT about 15 miles from Dr Cummings [see: ;;;;;;;;;;																								
"Lyme disease - USA (Massachusetts) (02) <a href=""""f?p=2400:1001:2204354500940171::::F2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE,F2400_P1001_ARCHIVE_NUMBER,F2400_P1001_USE_ARCHIVE:1001,20020516.4231,Y"""">20020516.4231</a>]. During the summer ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
months my practice sees close to one case of acute Lyme disease daily. Many ;;;;;;;;;;																									
of these are not reported because patients here are attuned to the early ;;;;;;;;;;																									
signs and symptoms of Lyme/ECM [erythema chronicum migrans]. Under current ;;;;;;;;;;																									
guidelines (State of CT and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"[CDC]) only ECM larger than 5cm is """"reportable"""". Since many cases of ECM ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
with myalgias/fever are smaller than 5cm	 we do consider them as probable ;;;;;;;;;;																								
Lyme and treat accordingly but do not report them. Of course	 some of these ;;;;;;;;;;																								
may not be Lyme	 but probably most are. This is another source of ;;;;;;;;;;																								
underreporting. In addition	 I'm sure we fail to report many other definite ;;;;;;;;;;																								
cases just due to being busy	 forgetful	 and all the other myriad reasons ;;;;;;;;;;																							
for failing to report cases.;;;;;;;;;;

"<<a href=""""mailto:kdardick@dardick.com"""">kdardick@dardick.com</a>>;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
[Dr Dardick correctly points out that erythema migrans is only reportable ;;;;;;;;;;																									
according to the CDC case definition (reproduced below) if it is 5 cm in ;;;;;;;;;;																									
diameter or greater. It is likely that the size was set to decrease the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"number of """"clinically false-positive"""" skin lesions. It is important to ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
point out that CDC makes it clear that this is a surveillance definition ;;;;;;;;;;																									
and not a clinical one. Although this can account for some underreporting	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
it is still likely that much of the issue is related to the nonreporting of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
cases that would fit the definition.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease surveillance case definition (revised September 1996);;;;;;;;;;																									
-----------------------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
Clinical description: A systemic	 tick-borne disease with protean ;;;;;;;;;;																								
manifestations	 including dermatologic	 rheumatologic	 neurologic	 and ;;;;;;;;;;																					
cardiac abnormalities. The best clinical marker for the disease is the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
initial skin lesion	 erythema migrans	 that occurs in between 60 and 80 per ;;;;;;;;;;																							
cent of patients.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Clinical case definition: Erythema migrans	 or at least one late ;;;;;;;;;;																								
manifestation	 as defined below	 and laboratory confirmation of infection.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Laboratory criteria for diagnosis: isolation of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ from ;;;;;;;;;;																									
clinical specimen	 or demonstration of diagnostic levels of IgM and IgG ;;;;;;;;;;																								
antibodies to the spirochete in serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)	 or a ;;;;;;;;;;																								
two-test approach using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay or ;;;;;;;;;;																									
immunofluorescence antibody followed by western blot is recommended (1).;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Case classification;;;;;;;;;;																									
Confirmed: a case that meets one of the clinical case definitions above;;;;;;;;;;																									
Comment: this surveillance case definition was developed for national ;;;;;;;;;;																									
reporting of Lyme disease; it is NOT appropriate for clinical diagnosis. ;;;;;;;;;																									
Definition of terms used in the clinical description and case definition:;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
A. Erythema migrans (EM);;;;;;;;;;																									
For purposes of surveillance	 EM is defined as a skin lesion that typically ;;;;;;;;;;																								
begins as a red macule or papule and expands over a period of days to weeks ;;;;;;;;;;																									
to form a large round lesion	 often with partial central clearing. A ;;;;;;;;;;																								
solitary lesion must reach at least 5 cm in size. Secondary lesions may ;;;;;;;;;;																									
also occur. Annular erythematous lesions occurring within several hours of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
a tick bite represent hypersensitivity reactions and do not qualify as EM. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
For most patients	 the expanding EM lesion is accompanied by other acute ;;;;;;;;;;																								
symptoms	 particularly fatigue	 fever	 headache	 mild stiff neck	 ;;;;;;;;;;																				
arthralgia	 or myalgia. These symptoms are typically intermittent. The ;;;;;;;;;;																								
diagnosis of EM must be made by a physician. Laboratory confirmation is ;;;;;;;;;;																									
recommended for persons with no known exposure.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
B. Late manifestations;;;;;;;;;;																									
Late manifestations include any of the following when an alternate ;;;;;;;;;;																									
explanation is not found:;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Musculoskeletal system: recurrent	 brief attacks (weeks or months) of ;;;;;;;;;;																								
objective joint swelling in one or a few joints	 sometimes followed by ;;;;;;;;;;																								
chronic arthritis in one or a few joints. Manifestations not considered as ;;;;;;;;;;																									
criteria for diagnosis include chronic progressive arthritis not preceded ;;;;;;;;;;																									
by brief attacks and chronic symmetrical polyarthritis. Additionally	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
arthralgia	 myalgia	 or fibromyalgia syndromes alone are not criteria for ;;;;;;;;;;																							
musculoskeletal involvement.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Nervous system: any of the following	 alone or in combination: Lymphocytic ;;;;;;;;;;																								
meningitis; cranial neuritis	 particularly facial palsy (may be bilateral); ;;;;;;;;																								
radiculoneuropathy; or	 rarely	 encephalomyelitis. Encephalomyelitis must ;;;;;;;;;																							
be confirmed by showing antibody production against _B. burgdorferi_ in the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)	 demonstrated by a higher titer of antibody in ;;;;;;;;;;																								
CSF than in serum. Headache	 fatigue	 paresthesia	 or mild stiff neck alone ;;;;;;;;;;																						
are not criteria for neurologic involvement.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Cardiovascular system: acute onset	 high-grade (2nd or 3rd degree) ;;;;;;;;;;																								
atrioventricular conduction defects that resolve in days to weeks and are ;;;;;;;;;;																									
sometimes associated with myocarditis. Palpitations	 bradycardia	 bundle ;;;;;;;;;;																							
branch block	 or myocarditis alone are not criteria for cardiovascular ;;;;;;;;;;																								
involvement.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
C. Exposure;;;;;;;;;;																									
Exposure is defined as having been in wooded	 brushy	 or grassy areas ;;;;;;;;;;																							
(potential tick habitats) in a county in which Lyme disease is endemic no ;;;;;;;;;;																									
more than 30 days before onset of EM. A history of tick bite is NOT required.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
D. Disease endemic to county;;;;;;;;;;																									
A county in which Lyme disease is endemic is one in which at least 2 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
definite cases have been previously acquired or in which a known tick ;;;;;;;;;;																									
vector has been shown to be infected with _B. burgdorferi_;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
E. Laboratory confirmation;;;;;;;;;;																									
As noted above	 laboratory confirmation of infection with _B. burgdorferi_ ;;;;;;;;;;																								
is established when a laboratory isolates the spirochete from tissue or ;;;;;;;;;;																									
body fluid	 detects diagnostic levels of IgM or IgG antibodies to the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
spirochete in serum or CSF	 or detects a significant change in antibody ;;;;;;;;;;																								
levels in paired acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples. States may ;;;;;;;;;;																									
determine the criteria for laboratory confirmation and diagnostic levels of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
antibody. Syphilis and other known causes of biologic false-positive ;;;;;;;;;;																									
serologic test results should be excluded when laboratory confirmation has ;;;;;;;;;;																									
been based on serologic testing alone.;;;;;;;;;;

disease	 erythema migrans and ehrlichiosis than streptococcal pharyngitis	 ;;;;;;;;;;																							
otitis media and pneumonia combined is shocking	 and I hope that it might ;;;;;;;;;;																								
serve as a wake-up call to other ER doctors as well as other MDs [in ;;;;;;;;;;																									
endemic areas -Mod.LL].;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In parts of northern California	 we have a high nymphal tick infection rate ;;;;;;;;;;																								
(averaging 12 percent	 range 4-41 percent)	 but frequently patients ;;;;;;;;;;																							
encounter either ignorance or skepticism at the doctor's office. An active ;;;;;;;;;;																									
surveillance study done in 1988-1989 in my rural community of about 100 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
people showed that 24 percent of the study participants were seropositive ;;;;;;;;;;																									
(by IFA) for Lyme disease and 37 percent had definite or probable Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease	 2 percent also had babesiosis	 but we did not test for ;;;;;;;;;;																							
ehrlichiosis. The researchers concluded that the annual incidence of LD was ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"1.7 percent, """"comparable to or higher than the cumulative ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"frequencies/incidences from the Northeast."""" (Lane RS, Mannweiler SA, Stubbs ;;;;;;;;;;"

northern California. Am J Epidemiol 1992; 136:1358-68.);;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In a recent follow-up survey I did of my neighborhood	 all but 2 of 71 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
individuals reported multiple tick bites. With high nymphal tick infection ;;;;;;;;;;																									
rates	 it only seems logical that sooner or later people would get Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																								
disease or other tick borne diseases - but trying to get an MD to test and ;;;;;;;;;;																									
then to treat adequately (they tend to discount relapses or persistent ;;;;;;;;;;																									
infection) is a continual challenge.;;;;;;;;;;

"but we did not test for ehrlichiosis."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
I wonder about the accuracy of serological tests for antibody to _Borrelia ;;;;;;;;;;																									
burgdorferi_. If a healthy person with no history of a Lyme disease-like ;;;;;;;;;;																									
illness has antibody to this etiologic agent	 what does that mean? I am ;;;;;;;;;;																								
"certain that the above statement, that """"24 per cent of the study ;;;;;;;;;;"

"had definite or probable Lyme disease,"""" is incorrect, given that a ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
serological test cannot determine whether a person is ill.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Tests for antibody to _Borrelia burgdorferi_ or other borreliae are ;;;;;;;;;;																									
notoriously nonspecific and provide inflated estimates of the prevalence ;;;;;;;;;;																									
and geographic distribution of this disease. While I have no doubt that ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease was underdiagnosed or even unrecognized until about 15 years ;;;;;;;;;;																									
ago	 I hope that nonspecific serological results are not being used to ;;;;;;;;;;																								
change the perception of the importance of this disease so that it can be ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"added to the growing list of """"emerging"""" diseases.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;

[Whether the screening test for Lyme borreliosis is the indirect ;;;;;;;;;;																									
immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or the more commonly used enzyme linked ;;;;;;;;;;																									
immunosorbent assay (ELISA)	 there is a significant false positive rate in ;;;;;;;;;;																								
patients who	 based on clinical symptoms	 are not likely to have active ;;;;;;;;;;																							
disease. A western blot (WB) is particularly useful in increasing the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
information gained from serology if the initial screening (ELISA or IFA) ;;;;;;;;;;																									
test is inconclusive.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
It is certainly the case that the relevance of a positive serology in a ;;;;;;;;;;																									
totally asymptomatic person is unclear. Do such people	 especially if with ;;;;;;;;;;																								
a positive WB and in an area where the disease is endemic	 need treatment? ;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
I'm a practicing emergency physician in northeastern Connecticut (right ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
where Rhode Island	 Massachusetts	 and Connecticut converge in the ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Northeast corner).;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
My observation is that a lot of the reported rates of Lyme disease are ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
skewed by reporting bias. That is	 practitioners under-report Lyme.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme and other co-infections (ehrlichiosis and babesiosis etc.) are all ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
reportable conditions and certainly we do backflips to report them. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
However	 I'm sure even then a lot of cases are missed. Probably simply ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
because of the sheer volume of cases	 plus the notorious under-reporting ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
from doctor's offices. Plus	 I'd bet that serologically confirmed cases are ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
reported a lot more commonly than primary ECM (and the ECM cases outnumber ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
the serologically confirmed cases hands-down).;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
During summer months I see more Lyme/ECM/ehrlichosis than I see ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
streptococcal pharyngitis	 otitis media	 and pneumonia combined. All ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
febrile illnesses in the summer months are suspected Lyme or ehrlichiosis ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
(we screen for the latter with CBC and SGOT). We also see radiculitis	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Bell's palsy	 and even an aseptic meningitis-like picture a lot. I'm ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
certain that our incidence rates are sky-high.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Anyway	 my point is that Lyme and Ehrlichia are probably all over New ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
England in the wooded areas (and I personally think being near a watershed ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
has something to do with it) and that rising rates are often just reporting ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
bias (better reporting). We really have very poor ways to determine true ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
incidence from clinicians. The reports from Massachusetts need to be ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
interpreted in this light.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
I personally think there's also a lot to be learned about the biology of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme yet.;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
[Dr. Cummings' comments related to under-reporting of many infections is ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
certainly true.  It is particularly relevant when the primary diagnosis is ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
made clinically rather than from a serological or microbiological ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
test.  The latter situations can be reported by the laboratory.  There is ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
always the confounding situation of more reports related to increased ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
publicity and better recognition.  Even with this in mind	 the information ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
from Massachusetts does suggest an increase in numbers in areas where the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease has been seen and spread to other areas.  These increases	 in the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
setting of the withdrawal of the Lyme borreliosis vaccine	 further ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
underscore the need for modalities and behaviors to limit potential ;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
[One of the challenges to the public health systems around the world is how ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"to get the """"private sector"""" to report cases of notifiable diseases that are ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
seen in their outpatient practice.  As most hospitals (at least in the USA) ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
have an infection control officer	 occurrences of notifiable diseases have ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
a greater likelihood of being reported to the public health sector as part ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
of the routine work conducted by infection control officers.  Dr. Cummings ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
is correct when he speculates that there is probably a high degree of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
under-reporting of Lyme disease as the majority of cases tend to present to ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
outpatient services	 and frequently there is empirical treatment without ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
laboratory confirmation. - Mod.MPP];;;;;;;;;;

Lyme Disease on the rise in MetroWest	 Massachusetts;;;;;;;;;;																								
-----------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
A summertime disease once confined to Cape Cod	 the islands	 and rural ;;;;;;;;;;																							
areas of Massachusetts with a large amount of grasses and deer	 Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																								
disease is staking its claim in MetroWest. Local physicians and state ;;;;;;;;;;																									
public health officials have seen an increase in cases but aren't exactly ;;;;;;;;;;																									
sure what is causing the spike.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
It's certainly fair to say Lyme disease is on the rise across the state ;;;;;;;;;;																									
"especially in counties it hasn't historically been at high levels,"""" said ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
Melissa Cummings	 an epidemiologist at the Massachusetts Department of ;;;;;;;;;;																								
Public Health.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Cummings said statistics for Lyme disease cases this year won't be ;;;;;;;;;;																									
available until next year	 but physicians are reporting more adults and ;;;;;;;;;;																								
children visiting their offices with symptoms or concerns.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dr. Andrew Baumel	 a pediatrician in Framingham	 MA	 said this year is the ;;;;;;;;;;																						
first he's ever had patients with Lyme disease. In the last 3 weeks	 he ;;;;;;;;;;																								
said he's diagnosed 5 patients from towns like Hopkinton	 Medway	 and ;;;;;;;;;;																							
"Millis with the disease. """"It's amazing,"""" he said. """"All of a sudden I'm ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"seeing everyone with Lyme disease."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Cummings said there's no definitive explanation for the increase in cases ;;;;;;;;;;																									
but said a combination of factors are believed to be at play. The disease ;;;;;;;;;;																									
is transmitted from animals to humans by deer ticks and is most common in ;;;;;;;;;;																									
the Northeast region of the country because the environment is conducive to ;;;;;;;;;;																									
the deer tick.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Changes in temperature and moisture in the environment	 an increase in the ;;;;;;;;;;																								
animal population	 more food and water sources for animals and a mild ;;;;;;;;;;																								
winter are all factors in the prevalence of the disease in counties across ;;;;;;;;;;																									
the state. Last year	 the highest rates of Lyme disease (24 cases per 100 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
000) were in Berkshire	 Plymouth	 and Barnstable counties as well as the ;;;;;;;;;;																							
islands	 said Cummings.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dr. Jonathan Snider	 a Hopkinton family physician	 said he has seen a 25 ;;;;;;;;;;																							
percent increase in the number of patients coming to the office with ;;;;;;;;;;																									
symptoms of Lyme disease and tick bites.;;;;;;;;;;

[Medical practitioners and patients in Massachusetts need to be keep an ;;;;;;;;;;																									
increasing watch for Lyme borreliosis.  With the 2001-2002 winter being ;;;;;;;;;;																									
relatively mild	 the reservoirs for the infection (ticks	 rodents	 and ;;;;;;;;;;																						
deer) survived in greater numbers	 and this may account for the increasing ;;;;;;;;;;																								
recognition.  Missing the early manifestations of the infection	 such as ;;;;;;;;;;																								
the characteristic (but not always seen) erythema migrans	 may predispose ;;;;;;;;;;																								
the affected but not treated patient to late complications such as ;;;;;;;;;;																									
arthritis. - Mod.LL];;;;;;;;;;

The Lyme disease tick creeps into the suburbs;;;;;;;;;;																									
------------------------------------------------------------------;;;;;;;;;;																									
In just 3 years	 from 1998 to 2001	 the number of confirmed cases of Lyme ;;;;;;;;;;																							
disease doubled or tripled in Berkshire	 Bristol	 Franklin	 Hampden	 ;;;;;;;;;;																					
Norfolk	 Plymouth	 and Worcester counties of Massachusetts.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Even Suffolk and Middlesex counties	 more urban than the more wooded ;;;;;;;;;;																								
counties to the west and still among the safest places in the state to be ;;;;;;;;;;																									
when it comes to tick bites	 have seen Lyme disease cases grow 5-fold since ;;;;;;;;;;																								
1990.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The whole state now is at risk,"""" said Alfred DeMaria, director of ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
communicable disease control for the state Department of Public Health	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
It's not just the Cape [Cod]	 the islands	 and Cape Ann anymore. It's ;;;;;;;;;;																							
"everywhere."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
At the same time	 the medical community has been stymied in its efforts to ;;;;;;;;;;																								
reliably prevent	 diagnose	 and treat the disease. This winter	 the ;;;;;;;;;;																						
manufacturer of the only approved vaccine to prevent Lyme disease pulled ;;;;;;;;;;																									
its product off the market citing poor sales. That has left public health ;;;;;;;;;;																									
officials redoubling efforts to avoid what many are predicting: that cases ;;;;;;;;;;																									
of Lyme disease will set new records again this season.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Since CDC began tracking reports of Lyme disease in 1982	 more than 145 000 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
cases have been reported. Massachusetts is in a group of 8 northeastern ;;;;;;;;;;																									
states accounting for nearly 90 percent of USA case reports. The actual ;;;;;;;;;;																									
number of cases is likely higher since not every case is reported.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
According to David L. Weld	 executive director of the American Lyme Disease ;;;;;;;;;;																								
Foundation	 record numbers of Lyme disease could be seen this year. During ;;;;;;;;;;																								
the 1990s and continuing into the year 2000	 the number of reported cases ;;;;;;;;;;																								
of Lyme disease nationwide was higher in each of the even-numbered years.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease in humans is caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
which can be traced to the blood of certain small rodents	 particularly ;;;;;;;;;;																								
white-footed mice. Tiny ticks	 in their earliest stages of development	 ;;;;;;;;;;																							
feed on the blood of these mice	 contracting the bacteria. As the ticks ;;;;;;;;;;																								
mature	 they feed on larger animals	 such as white-tailed deer. Because the ;;;;;;;;;;																							
ticks have a 2-year life cycle	 Weld said it is believed that the adult ;;;;;;;;;;																								
ticks	 which come into contact most often with humans in the grasses and ;;;;;;;;;;																								
woods inhabited by deer	 cause the spike in Lyme disease numbers every 2 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
years. Rising deer populations and increased residential development near ;;;;;;;;;;																									
wooded areas are often blamed for the deepening public health concern in ;;;;;;;;;;																									
communities previously unaffected by the infection.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The small town of Norwood in metropolitan Boston reported 5 cases last ;;;;;;;;;;																									
year	 none in 1998. In Ludlow	 a town in the Quabbin River valley	 the ;;;;;;;;;;																						
number of dogs destroyed last year related to canine Lyme disease was 4 ;;;;;;;;;;																									
times what was seen in prior years.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The numbers here have increased astronomically in the last 3 years,"""" said ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"Doreen Rae, a director of nursing in the town, """"And in Wilbraham and Munson ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"and Hamden."""" Officials in Ludlow have been working with the Harvard School ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
of Public Health and Connecticut Children's Hospital to track Lyme disease. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Tick sweeps were performed and the ticks tested for the bacteria ;;;;;;;;;;																									
responsible for causing Lyme disease infections. In 1990	 Rae said	 less ;;;;;;;;;;																							
than 2 percent of the ticks tested carried the bacteria. In the latest ;;;;;;;;;;																									
tests	 more than half the ticks have tested positive.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The only vaccine approved by the FDA for protection against Lyme disease	 ;;;;;;;;;;																								
LYMErix	 was voluntarily removed from the market in February. Last year	the ;;;;;;;;;;																							
FDA conducted an inquiry into 905  postmarketing ''adverse event reports'' ;;;;;;;;;;																									
regarding the vaccine since approved in late 1998	 concluding that most ;;;;;;;;;;																								
were consistent with adverse effects noted during clinical trials. The FDA ;;;;;;;;;;																									
stated	 however	 that further study was needed of vaccine users who ;;;;;;;;;;																							
developed arthritis or facial paralysis. [It is not at all clear if these ;;;;;;;;;;																									
more serious events temporally related to vaccination were a direct ;;;;;;;;;;																									
consequence of it. - Mod.LL];;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Ramona DuBose	 a spokeswoman for GlaxoSmithKline	 the manufacturer of ;;;;;;;;;;																							
LYMErix	 said the sales of the vaccine have dropped sharply. In 1999	 sales ;;;;;;;;;;																							
were $40 million	 representing about 1.5 million doses of the vaccine. In ;;;;;;;;;;																								
2002	 only about 10 000 patients were expected to request the vaccine. [The ;;;;;;;;;;																								
primary series of this immunogen has been 2 doses given 1 month apart with ;;;;;;;;;;																									
a booster 12 months later.  Additional yearly booster may have been needed ;;;;;;;;;;																									
as well - see below - Mod.LL];;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"The demand has not been there for this particular vaccine,"""" DuBose said. ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
While the medical world continues its work on the disease	 others are ;;;;;;;;;;																								
looking for an environmental solution.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
David Simser	 an entomologist with the Barnstable County Cooperative ;;;;;;;;;;																								
Extension Service	 is participating in a 4-state field test of 2 systems ;;;;;;;;;;																								
for targeted distribution of a pesticide that public health officials hope ;;;;;;;;;;																									
may kill enough ticks to make a difference in the fight against Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The first is a system of bait-box devices that can be placed around a ;;;;;;;;;;																									
property to attract mice and other small rodents. Once inside the box	 an ;;;;;;;;;;																								
insecticide called fibronil coats their fur	 killing early-stage ticks and ;;;;;;;;;;																								
protecting the rodent from developing more ticks for at least a month. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Field tests will be conducted this spring and summer in NY	 NJ	 and CT as ;;;;;;;;;;																							
well as MA. A second device is a 4-poster setup designed to attract adult ;;;;;;;;;;																									
deer and coat them with a pesticide that kills the adult ticks.;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
[The Lyme borreliosis vaccine that has been withdrawn from market is a ;;;;;;;;;;																									
unique biologic. Produced using DNA technology	 the immunogen is ospA	 one ;;;;;;;;;;																							
of the outer surface proteins of the organism.  The anti-ospA antibody ;;;;;;;;;;																									
produced from vaccination was effective in preventing human infection ;;;;;;;;;;																									
despite the fact that the organisms usually do not produce ospA when ;;;;;;;;;;																									
replicating in humans.  The mechanism of action appears to be ingestion of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
antibody-containing blood by the tick and inactivation of the borrelia in ;;;;;;;;;;																									
situ in the tick.  Because adequate levels of antibody	 therefore	 are ;;;;;;;;;;																							
required at the time of vector feeding	 there is no time for an anamnestic ;;;;;;;;;;																								
response.  Some clinicians	 therefore	 were concerned that waning antibody ;;;;;;;;;;																							
levels might require a booster yearly just before the beginning of 'tick ;;;;;;;;;;																									
season'.  Targeting the ticks with pesticides has been attempted ;;;;;;;;;;																									
before.  It tends to be effective in small settings but is unlikely to have ;;;;;;;;;;																									
any substantial effect in natural settings because of the quantities of the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
ticks that would need to be killed. - Mod.LL];;;;;;;;;;

Lyme disease tracking indicates increased case numbers;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The number of reported cases of Lyme disease increased by 70 percent over a;;;;;;;;;;																									
six-year period ending in 1998	 the federal government said. The U.S.;;;;;;;;;;																								
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there were 16 802 reported;;;;;;;;;;																									
cases of Lyme disease in;;;;;;;;;;																									
1998	 compared to 9909 cases in 1992. The report attributed the rise to;;;;;;;;;;																								
more incidents and improved reporting of the disease.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Over the six-year period	 92 percent of reported cases were in Connecticut	;;;;;;;;;;																							
Delaware	 Maryland	 Massachusetts	 New Jersey	 New York	 Pennsylvania	 and;;;;;;;;;;																			
Rhode Island and;;;;;;;;;;																									
two north-central states -- Minnesota and Wisconsin	 the CDC said. The;;;;;;;;;;																								
majority of reported cases had onsets of disease in June	 July	 or August	;;;;;;;;;;																						
corresponding with the seasonal feeding activity of the tick	 the CDC said.;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Southeastern USA appears to have its own version of the tick-borne;;;;;;;;;;																									
ailment Lyme disease	 one that is not detectable by most standard tests	;;;;;;;;;;																							
according to Georgia researchers.  Extensive laboratory testing of 23;;;;;;;;;;																									
adults with the characteristic bull's eye rash showed that 70% were not;;;;;;;;;;																									
infected with the spirochete known to cause Lyme disease	 according to the;;;;;;;;;;																								
study published in the Nov.1999 issue of Archives of Dermatology.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Thirty percent of patients did test positive for the spirochete	 but on;;;;;;;;;;																								
closer analysis	 even in those patients	 the spirochete	 _Borrelia;;;;;;;;;;																						
burgdorferi_	 had a different protein composition than that causing Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																								
disease in New England and the Midwest	 said Dr. Michael Felz	 family;;;;;;;;;;																							
medicine physician at the Medical College of Georgia and principal;;;;;;;;;;																									
investigator on the study.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There is some kind of tick-transmitted illness here that acts like Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease but only fits the laboratory pattern 30% of the time	 at least when;;;;;;;;;;																								
you apply a test that was designed for New England and the Midwest	 where;;;;;;;;;;																								
"Lyme disease is more common,"""" Dr. Felz said. """"In other words, we may need a;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"whole new testing system for this illness in the Southeast."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
MCG collaborated with Georgia Southern University in Statesboro and the;;;;;;;;;;																									
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Fort Collins	 Colo.	 on the;;;;;;;;;;																							
CDC-funded study.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The three-year study included Georgians and South Carolinians who lived;;;;;;;;;;																									
within 200 miles of Augusta and came to the MCG Family Practice Center to;;;;;;;;;;																									
see Dr. Felz after developing enlarging red rashes	 2 to 8 inches in;;;;;;;;;;																								
diameter. Approximately 90% were certain they had been bitten by a tick.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Before each patient began the standard therapy of a three-week oral regimen;;;;;;;;;;																									
of the antibiotic doxycycline hyclate	 photographs	 biopsies and blood;;;;;;;;;;																							
samples were taken for a complete series of tests. Tests included the;;;;;;;;;;																									
sophisticated polymerase chain reaction assay for spirochete DNA in biopsy;;;;;;;;;;																									
samples; the PCR was positive in five of 23 cases.;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
These data [indicate] there is some Lyme disease here that meets the;;;;;;;;;;																									
criteria of current national lab testing standards. Yet the majority of;;;;;;;;;;																									
"cases -- seven out of 10 -- are something different,"""" Dr. Felz said. """"The;;;;;;;;;;"																									
tick;;;;;;;;;;																									
species transmitting this illness seems to be different and [that tick] may;;;;;;;;;;																									
be transmitting an organism that is very different [from _B. burgdorferi_].;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease in the southeastern United States seems to be due to;;;;;;;;;;																									
"genetically variant strains of the spirochete _Borrelia burgdorferi_,"""" Dr.;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"Felz said. """"These strains probably have a different DNA backbone and cause;;;;;;;;;;"																									
different clinical symptoms and signs than is the case in other parts of;;;;;;;;;;																									
"the country."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dr. Felz	 who has studied ticks and the diseases they carry for 9 years	;;;;;;;;;;																							
"says this study is the """"most scientifically rigorous analysis"""" of Lyme;;;;;;;;;;"																									
disease ever in the southeastern United States.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease typically begins with an enlarging	 red circular rash and can;;;;;;;;;;																								
cause flulike symptoms of malaise	 headache	 fever and muscle soreness.;;;;;;;;;;																							
Left untreated	 it also can lead to more serious secondary problems;;;;;;;;;;																								
including arthritis	 nerve palsy	 meningitis and heart arrhythmias.;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Researchers found no evidence that the disease progressed to the second;;;;;;;;;;																									
stage in any of the study patients	 leading them to believe that the Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																								
disease organism in the Southeast may be a less virulent strain and/or more;;;;;;;;;;																									
responsive to antibiotic therapy.;;;;;;;;;;

The Lyme disease spirochete	 _Borrelia burgdorferi_	 has been isolated from;;;;;;;;;;																							
a blacklegged tick	 _Ixodes scapularis_	 removed from a songbird in Canada.;;;;;;;;;;																							
On 28 May 1999	 this engorged blacklegged tick nymph was removed from a;;;;;;;;;;																								
common yellowthroat	 _Geothlypis trichas_	 collected during bird banding on;;;;;;;;;;																							
Bon Portage Island	 Nova Scotia.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Atlantic Bird Observatory participated in collecting attached ticks;;;;;;;;;;																									
from passerine birds banded on Seal Island and Bon Portage Island off the;;;;;;;;;;																									
southwest tip of Nova Scotia. During spring migration	 21 ticks were;;;;;;;;;;																								
collected from 12 individual birds (4 species) from 14 to 29 May 1999.;;;;;;;;;;																									
These immature (larva	 nymph) ticks on birds included the rabbit tick	;;;;;;;;;;																							
_Haemaphysalis leporispalustris_	 and _I. scapularis_.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
As part of a monitoring program of ticks on birds in southern Canada	 these;;;;;;;;;;																								
engorged ticks were forwarded for identification by courier to the British;;;;;;;;;;																									
Columbia Center for Disease Control Society (BCCDCS) for spirochetal;;;;;;;;;;																									
analysis. At the BCCDCS	 the tick identifications were confirmed and the;;;;;;;;;;																								
ticks were surface sterilized using 10% hydrogen peroxide followed by 70%;;;;;;;;;;																									
isopropyl alcohol	 and transferred to sterile tissue to remove excess water. ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dead ticks underwent DNA analysis directly using polymerase chain reaction;;;;;;;;;;																									
(PCR) testing. For live ticks	 the midgut contents were cultured and;;;;;;;;;;																								
checked weekly by dark-field microscopy. Within 10 days	 characteristic;;;;;;;;;;																								
motile spirochetes were observed in one culture.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The isolate was immunostained with monoclonal antibodies of _B.;;;;;;;;;;																									
burgdorferi_	 and found to be reactive. Using PCR	 DNA amplification was;;;;;;;;;;																							
conducted on the isolate and confirmed positive for _B. burgdorferi_. This;;;;;;;;;;																									
is the first isolation of _B. burgdorferi_ from a blacklegged tick removed;;;;;;;;;;																									
from a migratory bird in Canada. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In fact	 it is the first isolation of _B. burgdorferi_ in Nova Scotia. On;;;;;;;;;;																								
route to Nova Scotia	 tropical-wintering species of birds	 (i.e. Swainson's;;;;;;;;;;																							
thrush	 northern waterthrush	 and common yellowthroat) fly through the New;;;;;;;;;;																							
England states which are endemic for _Ixodes scapularis_ and Lyme disease.;;;;;;;;;;																									
Interestingly	 song sparrows	 which overwinter in Nova Scotia	 were only;;;;;;;;;;																						
infested with rabbit ticks which are indigenous to the area(1).;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The first record of an _I. scapularis_ (reported as _I. dammini_) removed;;;;;;;;;;																									
from a bird in Canada was a nymph collected from a road-killed common;;;;;;;;;;																									
yellowthroat at Windsor	 Nova Scotia	 in late May 1990(2). Since then	;;;;;;;;;;																						
researchers reported immature blacklegged ticks on an American robin and;;;;;;;;;;																									
chipping sparrow at Thunder Cape on Sibley Peninsula	 Ontario	 in the late;;;;;;;;;;																							
spring of 1995(3). Of epidemiologic significance	 the common yellowthroat;;;;;;;;;;																								
acts as a competent reservoir for _B. burgdorferi(4)_ .;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Even though random occurrence of blacklegged ticks have been previously;;;;;;;;;;																									
reported in Nova Scotia	 no known population has been identified. The;;;;;;;;;;																								
present evidence clearly points out that spring migratory birds are;;;;;;;;;;																									
involved in bringing _B. burgdorferi_- infected _I. scapularis_ ticks long;;;;;;;;;;																									
distances into Canada.;;;;;;;;;;

Editorial Comment:;;;;;;;;;;																									
This report further extends observations of the blacklegged tick in areas;;;;;;;;;;																									
of Canada not currently known to be endemic. To date	 the blacklegged tick;;;;;;;;;;																								
has been shown to be endemic at Long Point and Point Pelee on Lake Erie in;;;;;;;;;;																									
southern Ontario. However	 the blacklegged tick has been documented in;;;;;;;;;;																								
Newfoundland	 Nova Scotia	 Prince Edward Island	 New Brunswick	 Quebec	;;;;;;;;;;																				
mainland Ontario	 Manitoba	 and Saskatchewan; isolates of _Borrelia;;;;;;;;;																							
burgdorferi_ have been made from ticks collected in several of these;;;;;;;;;;																									
provinces (Prince Edward Island	 New Brunswick	 Quebec	 mainland Ontario	;;;;;;;;;;																					
Manitoba	 and now Nova Scotia). ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Also	 _B. burgdorferi_ has been isolated from _I. pacificus_ and _I.;;;;;;;;;;																								
angustus_	 from different locations in British Columbia. In Alberta	 _B.;;;;;;;;;;																							
burgdorferi_ has been isolated from _Haemophysalis leporispalustris_. These;;;;;;;;;;																									
observations serve as an important reminder to the public in general	 and;;;;;;;;;;																								
physicians in particular	 that Lyme disease can be contracted in Canada in;;;;;;;;;;																								
areas not currently known to be endemic for this major tick vector.;;;;;;;;;;

FDA CLEARS NEW TEST FOR LYME DISEASE ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Food and Drug Administration has cleared a simple	 new blood test for;;;;;;;;;;																								
Lyme disease that can be used in a doctor's office. The test provides;;;;;;;;;;																									
results in an hour at the point of care	 compared to the standard;;;;;;;;;;																								
laboratory tests which have to be performed in a lab	 delaying test;;;;;;;;;;																								
results. This means doctors will be able to make a probable diagnosis;;;;;;;;;;																									
quicker and start treatment with antibiotics immediately.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The test	 the PreVue B. burgdorferi Antibody Detection Assay	 is intended;;;;;;;;;;																							
to be used as the first step in testing people suspected of having Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease. Positive results must be confirmed with a Western blot test done;;;;;;;;;;																									
by a laboratory. Two-stage testing is recommended by the Centers for;;;;;;;;;;																									
Disease Control. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread to humans;;;;;;;;;;																									
primarily by tick bite. It is the most common insect-borne infectious;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease in North America and is a significant public health concern. The;;;;;;;;;;																									
infectious agent in the disease is the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease may have many different manifestations. It starts with a;;;;;;;;;;																									
large	 red rash at the site of the tick bite. Then flu-like symptoms may;;;;;;;;;;																								
set in. It may affect the nervous system	 and	 in later stage	 may be;;;;;;;;;;																						
manifest by persistent arthritis. Diagnosing Lyme disease can be;;;;;;;;;;																									
challenging because the symptoms of flu	 fatigue and joint pain are similar;;;;;;;;;;																								
to those of a number of other conditions. The new test	 made by Chembio;;;;;;;;;;																								
Diagnostic Systems of Medford	 N.Y.	 uses antigenic proteins developed by;;;;;;;;;;																							
recombinant DNA techniques rather than the whole cell B. burgdorferi;;;;;;;;;;																									
preparations used in current laboratory tests. Antigenic proteins developed;;;;;;;;;;																									
by recombinant DNA techniques allow for more accuracy.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
FDA's clearance of the PreVue test was based on results of clinical studies;;;;;;;;;;																									
conducted by the manufacturer at clinics and physician offices. PreVue;;;;;;;;;;																									
accurately detected Lyme disease in 72 percent of one group of 120 blood;;;;;;;;;;																									
samples	 and 95 percent of another group of 42 blood samples. The test;;;;;;;;;;																								
incorrectly identified Lyme disease in three percent of 100 blood samples;;;;;;;;;;																									
"in which it was not present. This """"false-positive"""" rate is similar to that;;;;;;;;;;"																									
of laboratory tests for Lyme disease. ;;;;;;;;;;

A Clark County man is the first ever confirmed case of Lyme disease in ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Nevada	 health officials reported Monday. The middle-aged man had lived for ;;;;;;;;;;																								
several months in the Lee Canyon area of Mount Charleston	 Clark County ;;;;;;;;;;																								
Health District epidemiologist Rose Bell said. No other details about the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
person were available because of confidentiality laws	 she said.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"This is the first laboratory-confirmed case,"""" Bell said. """"It's the first ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"I'm aware of."""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The man reported his symptoms within the past month but did not have the ;;;;;;;;;;																									
characteristic bull's eye rash [erythema migrans -DS]	 Bell said.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The man worked as a camp host in Lee Canyon this summer	 Don Eastis	 U.S. ;;;;;;;;;;																							
Forest Service recreation officer	 said.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
State Health Officer Randall Todd said 27 people have reported symptoms of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease in Nevada since 1994	 but none of the cases were confirmed in ;;;;;;;;;;																								
a laboratory.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
"We don't see very much of it in Nevada,"""" Todd said. In most of the cases, ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
exposures from a tick bite occurred out of state	 he said.;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
One of those cases was reported in Clark County in 1997 through the Nellis ;;;;;;;;;;																									
Air Force Base Hospital	 Todd said. Nationwide	 there were 3	446 cases ;;;;;;;;;;																						
reported in 1999	 most in northeastern states. The Centers for Disease ;;;;;;;;;;																								
Control and Prevention in Atlanta reported 2	141 cases so far this year.;;;;;;;;;;

[Unfortunately	 the report does not provide the details on the laboratory ;;;;;;;;;;																								
methods used to establish the diagnosis of Lyme disease in this patient. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
The laboratory diagnosis of this infection is one that is the subject of ;;;;;;;;;;																									
much debate among researchers and clinicians. Clinical laboratories vary ;;;;;;;;;;																									
greatly in their ability to perform serologic testing	 including Western ;;;;;;;;;;																								
blots	 for Lyme disease and one must interpret with caution a positive ;;;;;;;;;;																								
laboratory test result in an area with no known endemic disease. In a ;;;;;;;;;;																									
population in which the prevalence of a given disease is low	 the positive ;;;;;;;;;;																								
predictive value of a test for that disease may be quite low as well since ;;;;;;;;;;																									
the rate of false-positive tests does not ordinarily fall in a low ;;;;;;;;;;																									
prevalence population.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;

The approval of a vaccine against Lyme disease by FDA is good news for the;;;;;;;;;;																									
US. From Lyme disease experts and vaccine manufacturers I hear that it is;;;;;;;;;;																									
active against _B. burgdorferi s.s._ but not against the different variants;;;;;;;;;;																									
present in Europe. For that reason it is at present not useable outside the;;;;;;;;;;																									
US. Even in the US it is far from perfect.;;;;;;;;;;

FDA approves Lyme disease vaccine;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first vaccine against;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease on Monday. The vaccine	 SmithKline Beecham's LYMErix	 contains;;;;;;;;;;																							
a genetically engineered protein from the surface of _Borrelia burgdorferi_;;;;;;;;;;																									
bacteria	 which causes Lyme disease. This protein	 called OspA	 stimulates;;;;;;;;;;																						
"the immune system to produce antibodies """"that appear to disable the;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"bacteriums' ability to infect the individual,"""" according to an FDA;;;;;;;;;;"																									
statement.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The vaccine is approved for use in people between the ages of 15 and 70	;;;;;;;;;;																								
and is given in three doses over a one-year period.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
FDA Commissioner Dr. Jane E. Henney said that while the vaccine may be a;;;;;;;;;;																									
good option for people who spend a lot of time outdoors where the ticks;;;;;;;;;;																									
"that spread Lyme disease are common, she also warned that the vaccine """"is;;;;;;;;;;"																									
not 100% effective	 so other precautions should be taken. These precautions;;;;;;;;;;																								
include the traditional methods of protecting against the infection	 such;;;;;;;;;;																								
as wearing protective clothing	 using tick repellent	 and removing attached;;;;;;;;;;																							
ticks.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The approval follows FDA review of a study of the vaccine in almost 11	000;;;;;;;;;;																								
people living in the northeast US and Wisconsin	 where Lyme disease is;;;;;;;;;;																								
common. After two doses of the vaccine in the first year of the trial	 the;;;;;;;;;;																								
protection rate against definitive Lyme disease was 50%	 and in the second;;;;;;;;;;																								
year	 after three doses	 it was 78%. Safety and efficacy were shown when;;;;;;;;;;																							
the vaccine doses were given between January and April	 shortly before the;;;;;;;;;;																								
peak tick season in the northeast US. But FDA officials also note that it;;;;;;;;;;																									
is not known how long protection against Lyme disease lasts after;;;;;;;;;;																									
vaccination	 and that safety data on the use of the vaccine in pregnancy or;;;;;;;;;;																								
"in patients with chronic joint and neurological disease is """"limited.""""  ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Side effects of the vaccine include redness	 soreness and swelling at the;;;;;;;;;;																								
injection site	 and sometimes mild to moderate flu-like symptoms.  ;;;;;;;;;;																								
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Dr. Michael Caldwell	 a principle investigator on the Lyme vaccine trials;;;;;;;;;;																								
and Commissioner of Health for Dutchess County	 New York	 said that the;;;;;;;;;;																							
most recent studies that he has conducted indicate that the same efficacy;;;;;;;;;;																									
"can be achieved when the vaccine is administered over a 3-month period. """"We;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"hope the FDA gets that information rapidly and will change the labeling,"""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
"he commented. """"That way, we can get the full vaccine in before the next;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"tick season, which begins here in May.""""  ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that since Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease tracking in the US began in 1982	 over 99	000 cases have been;;;;;;;;;;																							
reported	 mostly from the northeast	 upper mid -west	 and Pacific coastal;;;;;;;;;;																						
states. ;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
We commend Drs. dos Santos and Kain for their report of concurrent;;;;;;;;;;																									
infection with babesiosis and Lyme borreliosis in a Canadian traveler.;;;;;;;;;;																									
However	 we feel that one point made in the report warrants further;;;;;;;;;;																								
comment.  Although specimens of the black legged tick	 _Ixodes scapularis_	;;;;;;;;;;																							
have been collected over the past 20 years at widely scattered localities;;;;;;;;;;																									
in all provinces of Canada between Manitoba and Newfoundland	 to our;;;;;;;;;;																								
knowledge	 reproducing populations of black legged ticks are currently only;;;;;;;;;;																								
endemic on the Long Point peninsula and Point Pelee National Park	 both of;;;;;;;;;;																								
which are located on Lake Erie	 Ontario. At most other Canadian localities;;;;;;;;;;																								
where black legged ticks have been reported	 only individual or small;;;;;;;;;;																								
numbers of adult ticks (usually females) have been encountered	 usually on;;;;;;;;;;																								
dogs or people (Lindsay et al. 1995).  This suggests that these ticks have;;;;;;;;;;																									
been adventitiously introduced to these widely scattered areas	 likely on;;;;;;;;;;																								
birds (Klich et al. 1996)	 but does not indicate that tick populations are;;;;;;;;;;																								
established.  Thus at the present time	 established populations of _I.;;;;;;;;;;																								
scapularis_ are focal and limited in Canada.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Although people or pets living outside of the two tick-endemic areas of;;;;;;;;;;																									
Ontario can be infested locally by an adventitious tick	 and hence;;;;;;;;;;																								
potentially infected with any of the pathogens associated with this;;;;;;;;;;																									
species	 the probability of this occurring is low.  This is reflected in;;;;;;;;;;																								
the low number of indigenous cases of Lyme borreliosis reported in Canada.;;;;;;;;;;																									
Similarly	 because _I. scapularis_ is not widely established in Canada	 the;;;;;;;;;;																							
probability that humans infected with Babesia microti elsewhere will serve;;;;;;;;;;																									
as reservoirs of infection for local populations of  _I. scapularis_ is;;;;;;;;;;																									
equally small.  However	 this does not negate the importance of clinicians;;;;;;;;;;																								
in Canada being aware of the possibility that these tick transmitted;;;;;;;;;;																									
diseases can occur. ;;;;;;;;;;

Over treatment and over diagnosis of Lyme disease have become associated;;;;;;;;;;																									
with inappropriate use of health services	 avoidable treatment-related;;;;;;;;;;																								
illness and substantial disability and distress	 according to a study from;;;;;;;;;;																								
Yale University's School of Medicine.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The study indicates that apprehensive patients can also cause doctors to;;;;;;;;;;																									
hastily prescribe treatments without fully recognizing the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;																									
"Although some of the improper treatment and diagnosis was """"patient driven,"""";;;;;;;;;;"																									
some responsibility did lay with the attending physician	 researchers said.;;;;;;;;;;																								
Of the 209 patients studied	 60% turned out not to have Lyme disease at;;;;;;;;;;																								
all	 but still made an average of seven visits to a doctor	 had four blood;;;;;;;;;;																							
tests and underwent 42 days of antibiotic treatment. Of that group	 42%;;;;;;;;;;																								
said they suffered depression after becoming convinced they had the;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease. More than half reported adverse events from the antibiotics and;;;;;;;;;;																									
20% sought additional treatment.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease remains one of the most difficult diseases to treat because;;;;;;;;;;																									
the symptoms may mimic other illnesses and lab tests are often unreliable.;;;;;;;;;;																									
Current endemic areas include the northeastern coast of the United States	;;;;;;;;;;																								
the upper Midwest and northern California into Oregon. Ticks carry the;;;;;;;;;;																									
infection and transmit the _Borrelia burgdorferi_ spirochete.;;;;;;;;;;

emerging in the northeastern and Great Lakes regions of the United States;;;;;;;;;;																									
as the deer tick (_Ixodes scapularis_)	 which transmits both infections	;;;;;;;;;;																							
increases in geographic distribution. Because _B. microti_ and _B.;;;;;;;;;;																									
burgdorferi_ reside in the same rodent reservoir (_Peromyscus leucopus_);;;;;;;;;;																									
and are transmitted by the same tick vector	 human co-infection may be;;;;;;;;;;																								
relatively common in endemic areas. In support of this contention	 up to;;;;;;;;;;																								
two-thirds of Long Island residents with Lyme disease have antibodies to;;;;;;;;;;																									
_Babesia_ species. However	 until recently	 only three episodes of;;;;;;;;;;																							
co-infection had been described and	 in each case	 a particularly severe;;;;;;;;;;																							
illness was experienced and one individual died. A recent report from New;;;;;;;;;;																									
England found that the severity of symptoms and duration of illness in;;;;;;;;;;																									
patients with concurrent babesiosis and Lyme disease was greater than for;;;;;;;;;;																									
either infection alone.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
_Ixodes scapularis_ ticks have been found in a number of provinces in;;;;;;;;;;																									
Canada and 205 cases of Lyme disease were reported to public-health;;;;;;;;;;																									
officials from 1984-1994 (105 locally acquired). However	 there have been;;;;;;;;;;																								
no previous reports of co-infections in Canada and	 to our knowledge	 no;;;;;;;;;;																							
case of babesiosis has ever been reported in Canada. This report describes;;;;;;;;;;																									
a co-infection of babesiosis and Lyme disease acquired by a Canadian;;;;;;;;;;																									
traveler...  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Discussion: This case represents the first description of human babesiosis;;;;;;;;;;																									
and the first report of a co-infection with Lyme disease recognized in;;;;;;;;;;																									
Canada. Human babesiosis in the northeast and Great Lakes regions of the;;;;;;;;;;																									
United States is caused by _B. microti_	 an intracellular parasite that may;;;;;;;;;;																								
be confused with _P. falciparum_ malaria both clinically and;;;;;;;;;;																									
morphologically	 as initially occurred in this case. The morphologic;;;;;;;;;;																								
features that permit discrimination from malaria include the presence of;;;;;;;;;;																									
"paired piriform stages and a tetrad configuration (""""Maltese cross"""") formed;;;;;;;;;;"																									
by binary fission of the trophozoite to form four merozoites. These later;;;;;;;;;;																									
forms are diagnostic for babesiosis but may be difficult to find. The;;;;;;;;;;																									
absence of pigment and gametocytes in babesiosis may also be helpful;;;;;;;;;;																									
distinguishing features. A new species of babesiosis (WA-1) which is;;;;;;;;;;																									
morphologically identical to _B. microti_ has been described on the west;;;;;;;;;;																									
coast of the United States and in Missouri.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The nymph stages of _I. scapularis_ are primarily responsible for;;;;;;;;;;																									
transmission of both Lyme disease and babesiosis. The nymph is less than 3;;;;;;;;;;																									
mm long even when fully engorged	 and most infected persons do not remember;;;;;;;;;;																								
a tick bite. It is probable that the small pinpoint lesion removed by the;;;;;;;;;;																									
patient in this case was in fact an engorged nymphal-stage tick. Nymphs;;;;;;;;;;																									
typically feed more actively in May and June resulting in a peak of;;;;;;;;;;																									
clinical illness in July. As in this case	 symptoms of babesiosis usually;;;;;;;;;;																								
begin 1 to 4 weeks after a tick bite. The clinical spectrum ranges from a;;;;;;;;;;																									
mild	 self-limited illness to a serious life-threatening infection with;;;;;;;;;;																								
severe hemolytic anemia	 thrombocytopenia	 renal failure and hypotension.;;;;;;;;;;																							
Mortality rates in the United States have been less than 10%	 and deaths;;;;;;;;;;																								
more common in the elderly	 those with splenectomy	 and those with HIV;;;;;;;;;;																							
infection.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Co-infection with other tick-borne agents has recently been recognized as;;;;;;;;;;																									
an important determinant of the outcome of infection with babesiosis. The;;;;;;;;;;																									
disease caused by the co-infection with both Lyme disease and babesiosis;;;;;;;;;;																									
was shown decades ago to be more severe in experimental animals. This;;;;;;;;;;																									
observation has now been extended to human co-infections. Krause and;;;;;;;;;;																									
colleagues reported that 11% of patients with Lyme disease in southern New;;;;;;;;;;																									
England are co-infected with babesiosis. Co-infected patients had;;;;;;;;;;																									
significantly more fatigue	 headache	 sweats	 chills	 anorexia	 emotional;;;;;;;;;;																				
lability	 nausea	 conjunctivitis	 and splenomegaly than those with Lyme;;;;;;;;;;																						
disease alone. Furthermore	 50% of these patients were ill for [about ]3;;;;;;;;;;																								
months [or longer] compared to 7% with Lyme disease. This increase in the;;;;;;;;;;																									
number and duration of symptoms may be attributed to immunosuppression;;;;;;;;;;																									
associated with babesial infection.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Recently	 immunoserologic evidence of co-infection with a third;;;;;;;;;;																								
tick-transmitted bacterial zoonosis	 _Ehrlichia_ species (HGE and HME)	 has;;;;;;;;;;																							
been reported. In a sero-epidemiologic study of residents of Wisconsin and;;;;;;;;;;																									
Minnesota	 9.4% of patients with Lyme disease had serologic evidence of;;;;;;;;;;																								
co-infection: 5.2% with HGE	 2.1% with babesiosis	 and 2.1% with both.;;;;;;;;;;																							
Similarly in Sonoma County	 California	 23% of residents were seroreactive;;;;;;;;;;																							
to antigens from one or more tick-borne agents: 1.4% to Lyme	 0.4% to HGE	;;;;;;;;;;																							
4.6% to HME	 and 17.8% to babesia-like piroplasm WA-1. These studies;;;;;;;;;;																								
indicate that tick-borne diseases are widespread and prevalent in some;;;;;;;;;;																									
regions of the United States. Travelers from Canada will be at risk when;;;;;;;;;;																									
they visit these areas during tick season (generally from May to September;;;;;;;;;;																									
in the northeast). Furthermore	 _I. scapularis_ ticks have been identified;;;;;;;;;;																								
in approximately 250 locations in Canada. Prolonged parasitemias that may;;;;;;;;;;																									
accompany co-infection with babesiosis	 or subclinical infection in;;;;;;;;;;																								
Canadian travelers who acquire any of the tick-borne pathogens	 may;;;;;;;;;;																								
facilitate transmission of infection to _I. scapularis_ ticks in regions of;;;;;;;;;;																									
Canada where they reside. Finally	 blood products are not routinely;;;;;;;;;;																								
screened for _B. microti_ or _B. burgdorferi_. Babesiosis may be;;;;;;;;;;																									
transmitted by blood transfusion and is a cause of febrile transfusion;;;;;;;;;;																									
reactions in endemic areas.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In summary	 malaria should always be considered in febrile travelers and in;;;;;;;;;;																								
cases of fever of unknown origin	 even in those without a travel history.;;;;;;;;;;																								
But clinicians should also consider babesiosis in the differential;;;;;;;;;;																									
diagnosis of febrile travelers returning from enzootic areas of the United;;;;;;;;;;																									
States where	 during the tick season (May to September)	 infection with _B.;;;;;;;;;;																							
microti_ and _B. burgdorferi_ is not uncommon. Furthermore	 we suggest that;;;;;;;;;;																								
all patients with a documented tick-transmitted infection be evaluated for;;;;;;;;;;																									
co-infection with other known tick-borne agents	 particularly if symptoms;;;;;;;;;;																								
are severe or persist after therapy. Given the current levels of travel;;;;;;;;;;																									
between Canada and the United States	 and the emergence of Lyme disease	;;;;;;;;;;																							
babesiosis	 and ehrlichiosis	 we must anticipate an increase in the number;;;;;;;;;;																							
of imported cases of these tick-borne pathogens in Canadians. Prompt;;;;;;;;;;																									
recognition of cases	 accurate identification	 and appropriate initial;;;;;;;;;;																							
management is crucial in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with;;;;;;;;;;																									
these infections. ;;;;;;;;;;

There is another consideration that should be voiced. ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Prophylactic measures that are prevalent in Lyme-endemic areas	 such as;;;;;;;;;;																								
wearing long pants tucked into socks	 and long sleeve shirts	 along with;;;;;;;;;;																							
body inspections for ticks	 could conceivably be loosened if people feel;;;;;;;;;;																								
that they are protected by the vaccine. Given that neither vaccine is 100%;;;;;;;;;;																									
effective	 this may lead to a false sense of security	 and perhaps even an;;;;;;;;;;																							
increased incidence of Lyme Disease. In addition	 in certain areas	 other;;;;;;;;;;																							
endemic vectored diseases	 such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis	 may also;;;;;;;;;;																							
increase in incidence. It is important that people not be lured into a;;;;;;;;;;																									
false sense of security by their having been vaccinated. The effect may be;;;;;;;;;;																									
unfortunately paradoxical. ;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
As an immunologist I applaud and welcome the Lyme disease vaccines as;;;;;;;;;;																									
developed by SmithKline and Pasteur Merieux Connaught. The fact that it;;;;;;;;;;																									
appears that it may require three boosters and a full year before full;;;;;;;;;;																									
effectiveness does not worry me. We seem to be too preoccupied with magic;;;;;;;;;;																									
bullets that work 100% and instantly. The fact that we might have a vaccine;;;;;;;;;;																									
with apparently 80% effectiveness is worthy of celebration.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
Some of the caveats that were posted by Martin Hugh-Jones should	 on the;;;;;;;;;;																								
other hand	 concern all of us in the health care profession. One: the fact;;;;;;;;;;																								
that the vaccine appears not to be ready for use in children is of great;;;;;;;;;;																									
concern for it is children who appear to be at significant risk. Not only;;;;;;;;;;																									
are they in more intimate contact with the ground	 as pointed out in the;;;;;;;;;;																								
posting by Hugh-Jones	 but their personal grooming is likely to be less;;;;;;;;;;																								
fastidious than with adults and as such increases the chance of disease;;;;;;;;;;																									
transmission by nymphs and adult ticks.    ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The second concern is the vaccine's safety. If the side effects	 of;;;;;;;;;;																								
soreness and swelling at the vaccination site	 and joint pain	 fatigue	 and;;;;;;;;;;																						
fever are transient and mild then this vaccine is not much different than;;;;;;;;;;																									
many other commonly administered vaccines. However the possibility of this;;;;;;;;;;																									
vaccine aggravating immunologically mediated pathology then that is;;;;;;;;;;																									
something which	 in my opinion	 requires serious investigation.  ;;;;;;;;;;																							
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The last concern that I have comes from my professional position as a;;;;;;;;;;																									
diagnostic laboratory manager. If this vaccine is truly wonderful and if it;;;;;;;;;;																									
generates a relatively safe level of significant protection and if it is;;;;;;;;;;																									
administered to large numbers of individuals then we need to very quickly;;;;;;;;;;																									
re-examine our diagnostic protocols. Currently immunodiagnosis is the best;;;;;;;;;;																									
tool we have for infections with _Borrelia burgdorferi_. However the vast;;;;;;;;;;																									
majority of ELISA screen assays employ a plethora of antigens including	 I;;;;;;;;;;																								
"believe, the Osp-A antigen. This could then lead to """"false positive"""" screen;;;;;;;;;;"																									
results which could presumably only be resolved at the Western Blot level;;;;;;;;;;																									
with vaccinated individuals having only the Osp-A band light up while;;;;;;;;;;																									
others would have a more broadly based immunological response to the;;;;;;;;;;																									
pathogen.   ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
All in all I still feel we have much to celebrate with the advent of these;;;;;;;;;;																									
vaccines and I for one celebrate their arrival albeit with the above listed;;;;;;;;;;																									
caveats. ;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;																									
[Firstly I should point out the caveats expressed were those of the;;;;;;;;;;																									
reviewing committee. I merely pulled the reports off the AP. Secondly	 Neal;;;;;;;;;;																								
raises a most important diagnostic point of the possible potential need for;;;;;;;;;;																									
vaccination markers or 'flags'. With many infections one finds that;;;;;;;;;;																									
vaccination and post-exposure titres are different but are they so with;;;;;;;;;;																									
Lyme disease? If we have any members with SmithKline or Pasteur Merieux;;;;;;;;;;																									
Connaught	 would they be willing to comment as to whether the need for;;;;;;;;;;																								
vaccination markers has been considered? - Mod.MHJ];;;;;;;;;;

FDA Panel OKs First Lyme Vaccine;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The first vaccine against Lyme disease passed a major hurdle as government;;;;;;;;;;																									
advisers reluctantly backed its sale	 despite a list of safety concerns.;;;;;;;;;;																								
Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted Tuesday that SmithKline;;;;;;;;;;																									
Beecham's LYMErix vaccine meets federal requirements for U.S. sale to;;;;;;;;;;																									
certain people at risk of the tick-borne illness. But the FDA panel had;;;;;;;;;;																									
numerous caveats:  --Nobody knows how many booster shots are needed and;;;;;;;;;;																									
whether getting boosters year after year will prove safe. The panel only;;;;;;;;;;																									
backed the initial three doses of LYMErix.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
--No one knows whether it's safe for people with chronic arthritis or;;;;;;;;;;																									
undiagnosed Lyme disease.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 it takes a year for LYMErix to build up optimal;;;;;;;;;;																								
immunity.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
#NAME?	 LYMErix initially is;;;;;;;;;;																								
just for people over age 15 because SmithKline is only now beginning;;;;;;;;;;																									
pediatric studies.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
It's rare that a vaccine be voted on with such ambivalence and a stack of;;;;;;;;;;																									
"provisos,"""" said Dr. Patricia Ferrieri of the University of Minnesota, who;;;;;;;;;;"																									
chaired the FDA advisory panel. Because Lyme disease is a serious threat in;;;;;;;;;;																									
"parts of the country, """"the benefits are on the side of the vaccine in the;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"short term,"""" said Dr. Dixie Snider of the Centers for Disease Control and;;;;;;;;;;"																									
"Prevention. """"In the long term, we don't know.""""  ;;;;;;;;;;"																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
The FDA is not bound by its advisers' recommendations but typically follows;;;;;;;;;;																									
them.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
SmithKline already has begun studies to answer some of the panel's;;;;;;;;;;																									
questions	 particularly about the booster doses. But the FDA panel also;;;;;;;;;;																								
demanded that SmithKline study the vaccine's long-term safety after it;;;;;;;;;;																									
begins selling.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In a study of 10	936 people in high-Lyme states	 LYMErix proved 79 percent;;;;;;;;;;																							
effective at preventing Lyme infections after the third dose. But the third;;;;;;;;;;																									
dose is given a full year after the first shot	 and the vaccine is only 50;;;;;;;;;;																								
percent effective in that first year. So FDA's advisers urged that people;;;;;;;;;;																									
be warned to continue to use insecticide	 avoid tick-prone areas and check;;;;;;;;;;																								
carefully for tick bites.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
But the FDA's biggest question is safety. LYMErix's main side effects were;;;;;;;;;;																									
soreness and swelling at the vaccination site	 plus a few days of joint;;;;;;;;;;																								
pain	 fatigue and fever. There is another concern: A small number of people;;;;;;;;;;																								
with advanced Lyme disease get untreatable rheumatoid arthritis	 associated;;;;;;;;;;																								
with natural development of antibodies to Osp-A. Scientists wonder whether;;;;;;;;;;																									
the vaccine itself could occasionally cause serious arthritis	 and if so	;;;;;;;;;;																							
whether some people are genetically vulnerable.  ;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
SmithKline insisted that people vaccinated so far have no more joint;;;;;;;;;;																									
problems than people testing a dummy vaccine. Still	 two people with a;;;;;;;;;;																								
certain genetic immune trait did develop temporary but unusual;;;;;;;;;;																									
arthritis-related symptoms in some joints	 and panelists urged further study. ;;;;;;;;;;

FDA Looks at Lyme Disease Vaccine;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
WASHINGTON  -- A warm winter and lots of rain had health officials reporting;;;;;;;;;;																									
an unusual increase in ticks early this spring	 and experts already have;;;;;;;;;;																								
environmental evidence that 1999 will bring an even larger population of;;;;;;;;;;																									
ticks that carry Lyme and other serious diseases. With parts of the country;;;;;;;;;;																									
facing a bumper crop of disease-bearing ticks this summer and even more;;;;;;;;;;																									
predicted next year	 the government this week considers the first vaccine to;;;;;;;;;;																								
protect against Lyme disease. It's not a panacea: the vaccine won't prevent;;;;;;;;;;																									
all Lyme disease	 requires over a year to build up immunity	 and nobody yet;;;;;;;;;;																							
knows how often people will need booster shots.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
In regions where fear of Lyme disease is so great that many people head for;;;;;;;;;;																									
a doctor as soon as they spot a tick	 public anticipation is high as the;;;;;;;;;;																								
Food and Drug Administration prepares to debate Tuesday whether SmithKline;;;;;;;;;;																									
Beecham's LYMErix vaccine is safe and effective enough to sell.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
SmithKline's LYMErix	 and a similar vaccine being developed by Pasteur;;;;;;;;;;																								
Merieux Connaught	 promise the first immune protection. The shots create;;;;;;;;;;																								
antibodies that recognize an outer protein of the Lyme bacterium in a tick's;;;;;;;;;;																									
saliva	 called Osp-A	 and neutralize it. Unlike typical vaccines that work;;;;;;;;;;																							
once an infection is inside the body	 the Lyme vaccine essentially blocks;;;;;;;;;;																								
the bacteria's transmission at skin level. On Tuesday	 SmithKline;;;;;;;;;;																								
researchers will tell the FDA's scientific advisers that a study of almost;;;;;;;;;;																									
11	000 adults given either LYMErix or dummy shots showed the vaccine was;;;;;;;;;;																								
about 80 percent effective.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
There are caveats: It took three doses	 the last given a full year after the;;;;;;;;;;																								
first	 to achieve maximum protection. SmithKline still is studying how often;;;;;;;;;;																								
people will need booster shots. It worked better in people under 65. Studies;;;;;;;;;;																									
in children	 most at risk of Lyme because they spend more time at ground;;;;;;;;;;																								
level	 are just beginning. And if the FDA ultimately approves LYMErix	 that;;;;;;;;;;																							
doesn't mean the vaccinated can get careless about ticks. It's not 100;;;;;;;;;;																									
percent effective and ticks carry more than Lyme.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
SmithKline hasn't announced a price for LYMErix	 and government researchers;;;;;;;;;;																								
say routine vaccination may prove cost-effective only for the high risk;;;;;;;;;;																									
individual -- like park rangers or frequent campers in Lyme-infested areas	;;;;;;;;;;																								
but not city lovers.;;;;;;;;;;																									
;;;;;;;;;;																									
NIH says scientists are trying to develop more effective vaccines. While;;;;;;;;;;																									
LYMErix just blocks transmission	 the NIH is funding studies into ways to;;;;;;;;;;																								
kill Lyme bacteria that sneak past that barrier.;;;;;;;;;;
